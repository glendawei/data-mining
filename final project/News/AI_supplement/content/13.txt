Cruise layoffs, exosuits and why French startups are bubbling up  Listen here or wherever you get your podcasts. Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Friday show, our weekly news roundup. And this is the very last regular Equity episode of the year. Yes, we still have a lot planned for you, but expect more special interviews, guest appearances and predictions than our normal fare. But that’s all to come. This time ’round we once again had Mary Ann Azevedo and Alex Wilhelm together to hammer through the key news from the week: We are back Monday with some really fun stuff! Stay tuned, we have done work just for you! For episode transcripts and more, head to Equity’s Simplecast website. Equity drops at 7 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts. TechCrunch also has a great show on crypto, a show that interviews founders and more!
