Don’t forget to jargon-check your AI  Hello, and welcome back to Equity, the podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, where we sit down with a guest, talk about their work and dive deep into the rest. This week, we had Nathan Baschez, the CEO and founder of Lex on the show. Lex is an AI-infused online writing tool, and Alex covered the company when it recently raised capital. Lex raises $2.75M for its AI writing tool that helps writers get past blocks  Alex really liked his last conversation with Baschez, so we decided to have him on the podcast to talk through a few key topics that have been top-of-mind in recent months: That last question is not simply idle musing. Not too long ago, back in 2020, investors could be observed discussing the economics of AI startups, with the perspective at the time indicating that while the cohort might have more difficult early economics, their numbers (gross margins) would improve over time. But what about when a startup is using, say, an OpenAI API for its core AI work? Will similar efficiencies bloom? Why AI startups’ economics will likely improve over time  Equity is back into its regular groove now that Disrupt is behind us — there’s more to come! And before we go: Check out the UpFlip Podcast where they unravel how great businesses are built, how they are run behind the scenes and how their success can be replicated. We think you’ll love episode 79, where they featured a guest who transformed his passion for gardening into a $7.3 million-a-year venture.
