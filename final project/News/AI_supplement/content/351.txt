YouTube Studio to give creators a generative AI tool to suggest video topics During today’s YouTube event, CEO Neal Mohan revealed that the platform is testing a new generative AI-powered tool in YouTube Studio that suggests video topics, making the brainstorming process easier for content creators. Called “AI insights for Creators,” the inspiration tool will generate ideas based on data about what audiences are already watching, Mohan explained. He used Mahna Ghafori, a travel content creator, as an example, saying her viewers are most interested in getting trip ideas. The AI tool suggests a video idea about Portugal’s history and recommends places in the area she could highlight for her subscribers.

Now, Mahna is freed up to think about all the ways she’ll make the video in her own style.” The feature is currently being tested with select content creators. According to YouTube, during an initial test, over 70% of those surveyed said that “AI Insights” helped them with ideas for videos. It will launch in YouTube Studio next year.
