Arm’s IPO targets $51B valuation, won’t resurrect private-market liquidity  Listen here or wherever you get your podcasts. Hello, and welcome back to Equity, the podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. Our Monday show covers the latest in tech news from the weekend and what’s making headlines early in the week. Why are we recording our Monday show on a Tuesday? Because yesterday was an American holiday, so we’re offset by a day this week. Do not worry, we’ll have your usual run of material this week; we’re just cramming to start! With that in mind, here’s what we got into this morning: Don’t forget that Equity is opening this year’s Disrupt. We’ll see you there!
