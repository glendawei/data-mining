What’s the opposite of a lean startup? Listen here or wherever you get your podcasts. Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Friday show, and we’re talking about the week’s biggest startup and tech news. This week, Mary Ann and Alex ran as a duo, covering a wide swath of startup and technology news. Don’t forget that the Equity crew are opening this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt event, so snag a bagel and come hang in a few weeks! Here’s the show rundown: And that is us until next week. Due to an American holiday, Equity will kick off on Tuesday next week instead of Monday! For episode transcripts and more, head to Equity’s Simplecast website. Equity drops at 7 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.
