Google Maps gains glanceable directions and an expanded Immersive View Timed to arrive ahead of the summer travel season, Google’s bringing new features to Maps focused on discovery and navigation. New “glanceable directions,” which Google announced in February, will start rolling out this month in the Maps app on Android and iOS. They’ll let users who opt-in track walking, cycling and driving trip progress from their lock screen or route overview, and see updated ETAs and notifications about where to make each turn.

Soon, Google will save places in Recent highlights even after you’ve closed the Google Maps window, and adds tools to remove places you’ve viewed, create custom routes between destinations and share a selection of places with someone else. Lastly, Immersive View, Google’s AI-powered feature on the iOS and Android Maps app that fuses together images to create a multidimensional view of the world, is expanding to over 500 landmarks. Among the highlights are Prague Castle and Sydney Harbour Bridge.

And where we have data available, you can peek inside of restaurants and cafes to help you decide whether you want to make a reservation.”
