When Snapchat first launched its My AI chatbot, powered by Open AI‚Äôs GPT technology, the product lacked appropriate age-gating features. So, it ended up telling a reporter, who was using an account registered as a teenager, how to cover up the smell of alcohol and weed and set the mood for sex. Snapchat also recently released its paywalled My AI Snaps feature, which allows the AI to send you generated AI images. At launch, the product doesn‚Äôt work very well. It‚Äôs not clear what AI tools Instagram would use to power its chatbots. But as generative AI booms, Instagram‚Äôs parent company Meta has been using these tools in many established facets of its business, like ad sales. In May, Meta announced AI Sandbox, which helps advertisers create alternate versions of ads, as well as background images and image cropping. The company also unveiled its own AI coding tool called CodeCompose, but it‚Äôs not available publicly. Instagram did not respond to request for comment before publication. While riding the AI hype train, Instagram is also rumored to be working on a Twitter competitor. According to leaked information about the text-based app, codenamed Barcelona, this will be a stand-alone app that integrates with Instagram. Instagram declined to comment on the accuracy of the rumors at the time but did not deny them. If the rumors are true, Instagram‚Äôs Twitter clone should be coming this summer. Everything we know about Instagram‚Äôs Twitter clone, due this summer  Snapchat‚Äôs AI bot isn‚Äôt very smart, but at least it won‚Äôt send nudes
