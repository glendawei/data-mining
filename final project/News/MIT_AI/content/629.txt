Letter regarding the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing community forums in April  
 The following letter was sent to the MIT community on April 4 by Provost Martin A. Schmidt. To the members of the MIT community: I write to invite you to a series of three community forums with the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing Working Groups on April 17 and 18. As you may recall, in February five working groups were charged with developing ideas and options for the MIT administration to consider in planning the structure and operation of the new College, with the intent of completing this work in May. The forums will provide updates on the working groups’ discussions to date, and give you an opportunity to share questions, thoughts, and ideas with the working groups co-chairs leading the discussions.  Because some of the content that the working groups are exploring is overlapping, we have structured the forums as follows: Please visit the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing Task Force website for more information on the working groups and to contribute your suggestions to the Idea Bank. Your participation and input are important. The working groups and I hope that you will attend any or all of these forums. I also want to note that, beyond these forums, we will be planning additional opportunities for community engagement going forward as we plan for the new College. Sincerely, Martin A. Schmidt
