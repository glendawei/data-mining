Letter regarding the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing working groups and Idea Bank 
 The following letter was sent to the MIT community on Feb. 7 by Provost Martin A. Schmidt. To the members of the MIT community: In October 2018, MIT announced the establishment of the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing. The College aims to create a shared academic structure to facilitate the connection of computing scholarship and resources to all disciplines at MIT, and to provide opportunities for pathbreaking initiatives in computing-related education and research. At that time, we anticipated the formation of several working groups to develop ideas and options for creation of the College that can help the administration plan for its launch.  I am writing to let you know that we have created five working groups for this purpose, as follows: The full memberships of these groups, which include faculty, staff, and students from a wide range of MIT departments, can be found here. These groups will convene throughout the spring 2019 semester with the aim of producing a report describing their thoughts on these important issues by May. A steering committee — composed of the 10 co-chairs, Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, MIT Faculty Chair Susan Silbey, and me — will provide collaborative guidance to the working groups. In addition, we have established an Idea Bank in order to gain input from the MIT community. Community members can submit ideas related to the working group topics to the Idea Bank until the end of April. I wish to express my appreciation to all members of the working groups and the steering committee for their efforts on the important task of planning for the launch of the new MIT Schwarzman College of Computing in fall 2019. I am certain the guidance from their recommendations will help shape the College’s path to lasting success.  Sincerely, Martin A. Schmidt
