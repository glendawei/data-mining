Scene at MIT: The community gathers for Winterfest  
 As the sun faded on a clear Thursday afternoon, the MIT community came together to enjoy excellent food, music, and company at the annual Winterfest celebration. Each year Winterfest kicks off the holiday season and all that comes with it for MIT’s community members, from final exams to a much-deserved year-end break to Independent Activities Period in January. The event included a surprise lighting of MIT’s Great Dome in cardinal red, to honor President L. Rafael Reif, who will be stepping down from the helm at the end of 2022.
