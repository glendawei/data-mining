MIT community members who work to eradicate sexual violence recognized at 2023 Change-Maker Awards 
 On April 24, MIT celebrated outstanding students and employees at the annual Change-Maker Awards for their diligent work to eradicate sexual misconduct and support survivors. These architects of positive change exemplify one of MIT’s core values: striving to make our community a more humane and welcoming place where all can thrive. Hosted by MIT Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) and the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office (IDHR), the awards are held each April to coincide with Sexual Assault Awareness Month. The awardees were recognized at a ceremony among invited senior leaders and the faculty, staff, and students involved in the Institute’s sexual misconduct prevention and response work. The awards were held in person for the first time since 2019, making this year’s celebration with fellow community members a very special event. Chancellor Melissa Nobles opened the event by noting that, “Tonight’s honorees — individual students and staff members, a student group, and an entire office — are all amazing leaders and advocates. Day-in and day-out, they are making enduring contributions so that MIT is a more safe, supportive, respectful, and welcoming community for all.” Nominated by peers and colleagues from across MIT, this year’s Change-Makers were selected for their multifaceted contributions, creative approaches, and breadth and depth of impact. Honors went to an undergraduate student; a graduate student; a student group; an employee group; and a PLEASURE Peer Educator of the Year. For the first time in Change-Maker Awards history, Provost Cynthia Barnhart recognized a longtime MIT employee and Change-Maker with a special recognition award.
