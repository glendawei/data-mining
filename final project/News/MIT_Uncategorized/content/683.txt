MIT graduate engineering, business, science programs ranked highly by U.S. News for 2023-24 
 U.S. News and Word Report has again placed MIT’s graduate program in engineering at the top of its annual rankings. The Institute has held the No. 1 spot since 1990, when the magazine first ranked such programs.  The MIT Sloan School of Management also placed highly. It occupies the No. 4 spot for the best graduate business programs.  Among individual engineering disciplines, MIT placed first in six areas: aerospace/aeronautical/astronautical engineering, chemical engineering, computer engineering, electrical/electronic/communications engineering, materials engineering, and mechanical engineering. It placed second in nuclear engineering.  In the rankings of individual MBA specialties, MIT placed first in three areas: business analytics, production/operations, and project management. It placed second in information systems and supply chain/logistics.  U.S. News does not issue annual rankings for all doctoral programs but revisits many every few years. This year, the magazine ranked the nation’s top PhD programs in several science fields. MIT’s chemistry program earned a No. 1 ranking, shared with Caltech and the University of California at Berkeley. Its computer science program also earned a No. 1 ranking, shared with Stanford University and UC Berkeley. MIT’s mathematics program shared the top spot with Princeton University, and its physics program placed first along with Stanford. MIT ranked second among Earth science programs.  The magazine bases its rankings of graduate schools of engineering and business on two types of data: reputational surveys of deans and other academic officials, and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a school’s faculty, research, and students. The magazine’s less-frequent rankings of programs in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities are based solely on reputational surveys.
