MIT Press announces inaugural recipients of the Grant Program for Diverse Voices  
 The MIT Press has announced the first recipients of the Grant Program for Diverse Voices. Launched in 2021 to expand funding for authors whose experience and knowledge of diverse communities informs books that meet the highest standards of peer-reviewed scholarship, the initiative provides support for the research and writing of new works.  “The MIT Press has a proud legacy of bold, socially engaged publishing that champions the sharing of information and ideas from diverse perspectives,” says Amy Brand, director and publisher of the MIT Press. “As part of our enduring commitment to diverse voices and perspectives, we are proud to support these authors with grants to support the preparation and publication of their work.”  Grant Program for Diverse Voices Recipients:  Book titles are not finalized and are subject to change.  The Grant Program for Diverse Voices supports new or returning authors from diverse backgrounds. Grants can support a variety of needs, including research travel, copyright permission fees, parental/family care, developmental editing, and other costs associated with the research and writing process. Diverse Voices grant applications are evaluated twice a year, in the spring and the fall. The grant program is supported by the press’s Fund for Diverse Voices, a gift fund that champions the publication of new books by underrepresented groups at the MIT Press. The Fund for Diverse Voices has received generous support from the Heising-Simons Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and individual donors.
