2022 Ford F-150 Lightning: 320-mile EPA range beats Rivian R1T, efficiency meets it The U.S. EPA has posted range and efficiency numbers for the 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck—delivering more range, and thus better efficiency, than Ford had originally hinted for the much-anticipated truck. With the optional 131-kwh extended-range battery pack, the Lightning will have 320 miles of range in XLT, Lariat and fleet-only Pro trim. That's better than the "up to 300 miles" Ford discussed when it unveiled the Lightning in 2021. That range estimate shrinks to 230 miles with the 98-kwh standard-range battery pack.   2022 Ford F-150 Lightning EPA ratings With the addition of MPGe figures, now just posted, it becomes clear that the F-150 Lightning in that top extended-range version achieves the same 70-MPGe (48 kwh/100 mi) rating as the Rivian R1T in its sole version currently available. The F-150 Lightning is more efficient than the R1T in the city cycle. It earns 78/63 MPGe ratings for city/highway, while the R1T earns 74/66 MPGe, respectively.  2022 Ford F-150 Lightning vs. 2022 Rivian R1T EPA ratings The high-end F-150 Lightning Platinum, which is only available with the extended-range battery pack, gets a 300-mile range estimate. That exceeds the 280-mile estimate mentioned when Ford first revealed Lightning battery pack details in December 2021. Ford has said that on a 150-kw DC fast-charger, the Lightning will go from 15% to 80% in 41 minutes with the extended range pack, or 44 minutes with the standard-range pack. On an 80-amp Level 2 charger, it will be able to recover up to 30 miles of range per hour with the larger battery pack.  2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro The Lightning will also be one of the first vehicles in the United States to offer vehicle-to-vehicle charging, thanks to built-in bi-directional charging capability. With the right Ford-provided hardware and a compatible home installation, the Lightning can also provide backup power for the home, the automaker has said. In a first ride in the truck, we witnessed the finesse and quiet that its dual-motor powertrain offers.
