2023 Polestar 2: Single-motor up to nearly $50,000, 260-mile range expected for dual-motor The Polestar 2 gets a price hike of $2,600, to $49,800, at its base level for 2023, the company confirmed Wednesday, while Polestar 2 dual-motor models get a price increase of $2,100. And some versions are getting more range with the new model year. That reverses a price advantage held by the Polestar 2 for the past few months. In current pricing, the U.S.-made Model 3 starts at $48,190. With the tax liability, the federal EV tax credit can lower the effective price of the Chinese-made Polestar by $7,500, however.  The lineup gets a handful of other updates for the new model year, including fresh colors and wheels. Polestar also claims a boost to 260 miles (11 miles higher) for the dual-motor model, and a lower carbon footprint for the lineup from the use of renewable energy in the manufacturing process. Front-wheel-drive single-motor versions are rated 270 miles for 2022. New exterior colors are Space and Jupiter, which Polestar describes as "metallic black" and "gold-grey with red flake," respectively. The standard 19-inch and optional 20-inch wheels also get new designs, while on the inside the optional Nappa leather upholstery gets a new Zinc (grey) color and is matched with Light Ash trim. With the optional ($4,200) Plus Pack, the included heat pump now runs optimally at temperatures between 20 degrees Fahrenheit and 77 degrees Fahrenheit. That should further improve real-world range, Polestar claims.  2023 Polestar 2 Top Performance Pack versions add up to $58,880 and get an additional performance software upgrade, bringing an extra 68 hp and 15 lb-ft of torque. Polestar says that this will be offered as an extra-cost software upgrade on dual-motor cars later this year. Other small changes for 2023 include a removable sunshade for the 2's panoramic glass roof and an upgraded, app-connected cabin air filter. Polestar is also trying to lower its vehicles' overall carbon footprint by sourcing aluminum refined using renewable energy. The aluminum tray that carries the battery casing will see a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,653 pounds per car because of this, Polestar claims. The automaker said it is also using blockchain tech to ethically source battery materials, including mica and cobalt.  2023 Polestar 2 Both the Polestar 2 and Tesla Model 3 will soon be widely available at Hertz, while Polestar has tried a somewhat different model for its retail experience. The 2 is Polestar's only current model, but a U.S.-made Polestar 3 SUV is on the way. It will be unveiled later this year, followed by Polestar 4 and Polestar 5 models, the latter previewed by the Precept concept first shown in 2020. --UPDATE: This is an updated version of a piece originally published on April 28, 2022â€”adding further feature and pricing information.
