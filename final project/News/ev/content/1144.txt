Saudi Arabia agrees to buy up to 100,000 Lucid EVs In a deal announced Monday, the Saudi Arabian government will purchase up to 100,000 Lucid electric cars over a 10-year period, with initial deliveries scheduled to start by the second quarter of 2023. The deal includes an initial commitment of 50,000 vehicles, with an option to purchase 50,000 more, including the Lucid Air and "other future models," according to a Lucid press release.  The cars will be built at Lucid's current Arizona factory and a future assembly facility in Saudi Arabia announced earlier this year. It's scheduled to open in 2025 with a potential production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year.
