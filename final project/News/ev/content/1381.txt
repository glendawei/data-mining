At that time, we became the world’s first Li-Metal cell manufacturer to enter into an automotive A-sample JDA. We are now the world’s first to enter an automotive B-sample JDA for Li-Metal batteries. This achievement was the culmination of fundamental breakthroughs in material chemistry and cell engineering that led to a significant improvement in Li-Metal practical safety,” said Founder and CEO Qichao Hu. “Entering into an automotive B-sample is a major milestone towards the commercialization of Li-Metal batteries and the future of electrified transportation on land and in the air.” Battery World 2023 will take place at the following times: SOURCE: SES AI Corp
