WAE Technologies To Showcase Scalable Battery Innovation at JSAE WAE, the world-leading technology and engineering services business, will be showcasing an advanced automotive battery solution at a leading automotive engineering conference held by the Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan this May. Taking place in Yokohama between 24-26 May, JSAE sees the world’s leading automotive technology companies come together. At the event, WAE will be demonstrating its Scalable Battery Module (SBM), which utilises WAE’s proprietary ‘Sense Chain’ architecture to eliminate the replication of electronics, enabling independent scaling of voltage and capacity and the realisation of bespoke battery concepts in record time. Revolutionising rapid and flexible battery development, WAE’s modular toolkit enables automotive customers to create custom pack and sub-pack systems faster than ever, supporting low-medium volume electric vehicle developers across a range of industries. Each module is 1.08kWh with a voltage of 50V Max, 43V Nominal with an energy density of >240Wh/kg. As well as exhibiting at stand 1, WAE will also feature alongside other UK automotive technology leaders as part of the Automotive Propulsion Centre’s UK Pavilion. Rob Millar, Head of Electrical at WAE, commented: “We are delighted to be showcasing our Scalable Battery Module at JSAE. This innovative new technology offers greater flexibility and speed to market for customers across a wide range of sectors and is yet another example of WAE’s wide roster of cutting-edge electrification solutions for the automotive market.” To arrange an interview with any of the WAE team at JSAE, media are invited to reach out to Claire Rose, Head of Marketing and Communications at WAE, on the contact details below.
