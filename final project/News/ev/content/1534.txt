BorgWarner to Supply eMotors for Leading Automotive Manufacturer in China BorgWarner, has been selected to provide HVH eMotors to a leading automotive manufacturer in China. The eMotors will be used in the Chinese automaker’s DHT and REEV, with mass production expected to start in August 2023 in Tianjin. “BorgWarner’s HVH motor, in these applications, features a powerful, durable and high-performance electric generator that further solidifies BorgWarner’s leading position in the DHT and REEV markets,” said Dr. Stefan Demmerle, President and General Manager of BorgWarner PowerDrive Systems. “We are excited to supply this leading Chinese OEM with our new motor application, strengthening our partnership by providing them with the support needed to meet the growing challenges in New Energy Vehicles.” This HVH motor uses a compact design with an optimized conductor-winding structure that shortens the motor, making it suitable for smaller installation space, and improves efficiency on major driving cycles. Additionally, the motor has been designed with a reduction in heavy rare earth elements, leading to a lower motor cost. The optimization of the auxiliary slot provides reduced motor NVH levels, meeting customer requirements for a quieter vehicle, offers optimal cost and increased efficiency. SOURCE: Borgwarner
