Canoo Awarded Battery Module Contract for Advanced Testing The Defense Innovation Unit awarded Canoo, a contract to supply battery modules for analysis and demonstration. This award supports the U.S. Department of Defense focus to incorporate scalable and adaptable capabilities in tactical environments. “We are very proud to be selected by the Department of Defense and to contribute to our country’s global defense technology leadership. This award is another example of our focus and commitment to innovation. We’ve worked hard and continue to develop our patented technologies and ability to deliver flexible, on demand energy solutions that are multi-purpose capable, to serve America’s interests and its allies around the world,” said Tony Aquila, Chairman & CEO at Canoo. Canoo’s proprietary battery system is modular to support different vehicle configurations and engineered to provide industry leading energy density. The system is designed to be flexible and compatible with cells from leading battery providers and engineered to evolve with changes in cell size and chemistry as the industry matures, scales and reduces costs. This contract follows Canoo’s delivery of a Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army in November, and its selection to provide NASA with crew transportation vehicles to support the Artemis lunar landing missions.
