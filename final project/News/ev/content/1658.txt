BorgWarner Expands in Bangalore with Opening of Electric Propulsion Engineering Center BorgWarner has opened a 95,000 square foot (8,825 square meter) electric propulsion engineering center in the Whitefield neighborhood of Bangalore, India. The team there will work on inverters, DC/DC converters, on-board chargers, integrated drive modules, battery management systems and propulsion controllers. “Our Charging Forward strategy is accelerating BorgWarner’s electrification efforts,” said Guenther Raab, Vice President of Engineering, BorgWarner PowerDrive Systems. “We plan to grow electric vehicle revenues to around 45% of the company’s sales by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2035. The India Propulsion Engineering Center we are establishing in Bangalore will play a vital role in achieving these ambitious targets globally, while setting up the foundation for future growth in electric mobility. The tech center will focus on electric propulsion systems, software and electronics hardware capabilities including functional safety and cybersecurity in India to drive BorgWarner’s global platforms.” The technical center will employ more than 550 people in 2023, including several newly created positions. At the Auto Expo Components 2023 trade show that took place in New Delhi shortly before the new center opened, BorgWarner demonstrated how its sustainable product developments are helping OEMs make the transition to e-mobility in India. Global executives shared their future plans for the technical center with employees during the festive inauguration ceremony on January 18, 2023. The opening of this second technical center in Bangalore follows the December 2022 opening of BorgWarner’s 26,500 square foot (2,460 square meter) technical center in the Kundalahalli suburb of Bangalore.
