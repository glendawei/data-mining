The facility and local engineering will support our customers with highly skilled repair, maintenance, and services. BorgWarner will produce the ultra-high energy (UHE) battery system AKASystem AKM CYC. The battery packs are modularly designed and scalable, providing the opportunity to optimally adjust to the energy storage needs of any vehicle application. The start of operations and assembly of the battery systems is planned for the first quarter of 2023.
