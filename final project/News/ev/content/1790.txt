Valmet Automotive Completed First Lightyear 0 Pre-Production Solar EV Valmet Automotive has now at the Uusikaupunki car plant completed the first Lightyear 0 pre-production vehicle for Lightyear, the Dutch high-tech company developing the world’s first solar electric vehicle. The pre-production series is a major step toward the start of production of the customer series of the Lightyear 0 model scheduled for late 2022. Lightyear unveiled the final design for the Lightyear 0 model in June 2022. A dedicated team of Valmet Automotive employees trained and instructed at Lightyear’s facilities in Helmond, the Netherlands have now completed the very first vehicle to this specification at the Uusikaupunki, Finland car plant. All the pre-production vehicles will be built in facilities dedicated for prototype and pre-series manufacturing. The construction work of the assembly line for the Lightyear 0 customer production series is proceeding on schedule with active support from Lightyear experts. The assembly line will be located in the newest section of the Uusikaupunki plant. The new Lightyear 0 assembly line will feature state-of-the-art technological solutions, including a co-operative robot for laser welding and has a focus on work safety and ergonomics. The selection and training of additional car builders for the Lightyear 0 assembly has already started at the Uusikaupunki car plant. We are immensely proud at Valmet Automotive to have completed the first pre-production Lightyear 0 solar electric vehicle. This is an important step toward the start of customer car production and making an automotive dream come true. Valmet Automotive announced its manufacturing contract with Lightyear in July 2021.
