Bollinger Motors and Wabash to Produce Last-Mile Refrigerated Delivery Electric Truck Bollinger Motors, which recently became a majority owned company of Mullen, announces today it has teamed up with Wabash, a leading truck body and trailer manufacturer, to develop a stronger, lighter, refrigerated truck body on electric chassis. Wabash has developed a lightweight composite technology, EcoNex™ Technology, for use in truck bodies and trailers that will seamlessly integrate with Bollinger’s Class 4 electric chassis cab. Wabash’s EcoNex Technology is made from composite material that is more durable, lighter, and more thermally efficient than other commercial products. The companies’ unique offering includes: “Wabash’s EcoNex composite technology reduces the amount of electricity needed to maintain cold temperatures,” said Mark Ehrlich, VP new business development at Wabash. “The all-electric truck we’re developing with Bollinger Motors will be highly efficient with more uptime and less charging compared to conventional construction.” “I’m excited to help ‘green up’ the journey from farm to table,” said Robert Bollinger, Founder & CEO of Bollinger Motors, who was inspired to start the company while he owned a farm in upstate New York. “We’re confident Wabash’s expertise in commercial transportation, combined with Bollinger’s leadership in Class 4 electrification, will deliver a superior product for customers looking to reduce their carbon footprints.” On Wednesday, September 7th, 2022, Bollinger Motors become a majority owned EV truck company of Mullen. This is Mullen’s first EV acquisition and propels the Company into the medium-duty truck classes 3-6, along with the B1 and B2 sport utility trucks. Learn more about the acquisition here.
