Mullen Collaborate with TRE on Vehicle Chassis and Safety Development Mullen, announces today a collaboration with TRE (Team Rosberg Engineering) GmbH from Germany on vehicle chassis and safety development for the Mullen FIVE EV Crossover Program. Mullen is currently working with engineering partner ARRK to finalize the structural layout for the Mullen FIVE with computer-aided engineering (CAE) simulation loop. The program is on track to finish engineering development next year as originally planned. Mullen previously announced its partnership with leading German automotive engineering company ARRK in December 2021. ARRK is supporting Mullen with CAE, body in white, battery, closures, interior, chassis, thermal, and infotainment engineering. Additionally, Mullen has recently initiated a strategic collaboration with Team Rosberg Engineering (TRE) for vehicle chassis and safety development. TRE was founded in 1997 by Formula 1 world champion Keke Rosberg (‘82) as a development center for the series development of chassis systems. Nico Rosberg (Formula 1 world champion 2016) has been actively involved in the company since 2018, primarily focusing on New Mobility. With 25 years of experience, TRE’s competence includes all aspects of vehicle dynamics development. TRE is highly specialized in chassis development for production and prototype vehicles and is an independent tier 1 engineering supplier for several large OEMs worldwide. “The engineering work for the FIVE continues to progress in full swing. We’ve made rapid progress thanks to our incredible partners,” said David Michery, CEO and chairman of Mullen Automotive. “These new partnerships are accelerating our path to start of production, which we previously slated for Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. Having companies such as ARRK and Team Rosberg involved in the FIVE programs is a great privilege for Mullen.”
