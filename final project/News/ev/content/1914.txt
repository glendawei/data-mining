Porsche Acquires Manufacturer of Light and Compact Drive Systems for eBikes Porsche expands its eBike expertise. The Stuttgart-based sports car manufacturer takes over Fazua, a manufacturer of particularly light and compact drive systems for eBikes. In Fazua, we have found a strong partner with a great deal of experience in the bicycle industry,” says Lutz Meschke, Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG and Member of the Executive Board for Finance and IT. “Fazua is known among experts as the founder of the ‘light eBikes’ category – and it’s a highly innovative company that fits perfectly with the pioneering spirit of the Porsche brand.” After buying into the company with a 20 per cent stake in January, Porsche now acquires all of Fazua’s shares. Based in Ottobrunn, near Munich, the company is considered a pioneer in the development of lightweight and compact drive systems, such as the innovative new Ride 60, which it only recently unveiled. The sports car manufacturer already owns a majority stake in the Croatian eBike brand Greyp. In the future, Porsche’s eBike activities will be merged through the establishment of two joint ventures with the Dutch company Ponooc Investment B.V. The first joint venture will develop, manufacture and distribute a future generation of high-quality Porsche eBikes. The second will focus on technological solutions for the fast-growing micromobility market. Independent of the joint venture activities, Porsche will continue to work with its long-standing partner Rotwild on its current eBike models. In March 2021, the company launched its interpretation of exclusive electric bikes with the Porsche eBike Sport and the eBike Cross.
