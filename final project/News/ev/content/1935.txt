Bollinger Motors Selects Roush Industries to Assemble its All-Electric Platforms and Chassis Cabs Bollinger Motors announced Roush Industries as the contract manufacturer to assemble its line of all-electric platforms and chassis cabs for commercial vehicles in Classes 3 through 6. Bollinger will source and provide all materials for Roush to assemble its all-electric vehicle platforms and chassis cabs in a fully staffed, operational, and scalable facility in Livonia, Michigan – within 20 miles of Bollinger’s Oak Park headquarters. “We will be building state-of-the-art vehicles from day one right here in Michigan,” said Robert Bollinger, founder and CEO of Bollinger Motors. “Roush has significant engineering and assembly history, and we’re excited to work with them to provide our commercial fleet customers with exceptional electric vehicles.” “Roush will help us to hit our quality and production targets confidently,” said Bryan Chambers, chief operating officer of Bollinger Motors. “Roush’s knowledge base and track record in working with both startups and established OEMs was a big part of our decision.” Bollinger Motors will also work closely with Roush on assembling pre-production units and performing validation testing, ahead of the ramp up to production. “Our proven processes are engineered to bring products to market quickly and efficiently, while meeting OEM-level quality standards,” said Brad Rzetelny, vice president of Roush Flexible Assembly. “With fully scalable manufacturing, we can grow with Bollinger Motors to meet the growing need from its fleet customers as they convert to electric vehicles.”
