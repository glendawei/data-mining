The automaker now expects to be building 600,000 EVs a year sometime in 2024, Ford CEO Jim Farley said Monday in a discussion of the automaker's quarterly earnings report. Ford has been saying since 2021 (when it doubled EV targets) that it would attain that rate by the end of this year.  Ford at the time said it aimed to become the second-biggest EV producer in the world "within a couple years." Similar language was missing from Farley's comments, but he did say Ford "will maintain flexibility, balancing growth and profitability, on the way to attaining a two-million run rate" in the coming years.

Expected to be a replacement for the F-150 Lightning, the truck should arrive around 2025 alongside a a three-row SUV that Ford has promised will get 350 miles of range from a modestly sized battery pack.
