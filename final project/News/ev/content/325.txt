Meanwhile, the Model 3 for the same period was up 28%.

EVs and hybrids relative to entire U.S. vehicle fleet. - Experian But the U.S. fleet as a whole turns over slowly and the average age of passenger cars and light trucks remains about 12 years. In the first quarter of 2023, EVs made up 2.4 million total U.S. registrations (counting EVs of all ages)—amounting to just 0.86% of the vehicle fleet. While that’s a very minor portion of the fleet as a whole, that’s more than double the 0.40% of the fleet EVs added up to in Q1 2021. Hybrids are also climbing in the fleet makeup, though they’re not accelerating at the rate that EVs are relative to the overall fleet. They stood at about 7.3 million, or just over 2.5% of the overall fleet in Q1 2023, up from just over 2% of the overall fleet in Q1 2021.
