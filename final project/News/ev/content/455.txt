Sila claims 20% range boost with silicon-anode battery tech Battery firm Sila Nanotechnologies claims a 20% EV range boost, as well as faster charging, with its nano-composite silicon-anode battery tech, branded Titan Silicon. The company made that claim in a recent press release, adding that it has "a development runway to double those gains in future releases." Sila also claims its silicon anodes can allow for a 10-80% charge in 20 minutes, with plans to reduce that to 10 minutes.   Mercedes-Benz EQG Concept These gains can be achieved with comparable safety margins and life cycles to current graphite anodes, Sila claims, while reducing battery weight by up to 15% and increasing space by up to 20%. It could also maintain compatibility with current battery cell form factors and manufacturing facilities. The first automotive application for Sila's battery tech will likely be the Mercedes-Benz EQG, an electric version of the G-Class off-roader. Mercedes confirmed the tech for the EQG last May, with cells to come from a factory in Washington State using 100% renewable energy. The EQG is due in 2024, but Sila-sourced cells are slated for use in a longer-range version due later in the decade.  Mercedes-Benz EQG Concept Sila's closest rival in the race to commercialize silicon-anode battery cells is Group14 Technologies, another U.S.-based firm, which sees the tech as a path to faster charging, and thus a potential antidote to heavy, expensive battery packs. If EVs can charge more quickly, range becomes less important, just as with gasoline cars. The ability to easily find a gas station and quickly refuel means drivers of gasoline cars rarely think about range. Silicon anodes have been the next big thing since about 2018â€”and unlike some other trends in batteries very little has dampened the enthusiasm for them. General Motors is betting on them, too, backing developers in the hope that silicon-anode tech will provide more efficient batteries.
