Rear headroom is the only obvious compromise of the tapered, aerodynamically efficient roofline. Beyond the 5, Hyundai has also tweaked the propulsion system in the 6 for improved efficiency, and it’s including both a heat pump and battery heating system—perhaps making its peak charging time of 10-80% in just 18 minutes on a 350-kw fast charger a little more accessible. It’s also the first model from Hyundai to offer over-the-air updates for the complete car, not just the infotainment system. Because the Ioniq 6 is made in South Korea, it will not qualify for the revamped EV tax credit, termed Clean Vehicle Credit—although it might qualify for some state credits.  2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 Amid constantly evolving Tesla prices, the Model 3 currently costs $44,380 in Standard Range form, with a 272-mile range.

Last year, when the 5 was eligible for the EV tax credit, “market adjustment” surcharges of up to $10,000 were not uncommon, as dealerships exploited the situation. The Ioniq models still aren’t available in all U.S. Hyundai dealerships, but Hyundai says that it now spans 39 states. Hyundai says that most trim levels of the Ioniq 6 will be available at U.S. dealerships starting this spring, with Standard Range deliveries to follow this summer.
