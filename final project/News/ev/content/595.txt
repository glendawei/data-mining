In Edition 1 launch spec with Moonshot Green Matte paint, the first Hummer EV SUV was auctioned off by Barrett-Jackson at the company's Scottsdale, Arizona, event Jan. 28.

After developing the Hummer EV in record time, General Motors has slowed the pace when it comes to rolling out all of the planned variants. GM many months ago said that a price hike will apply to the 2023 GMC Hummer EV, but it hasn't yet delivered any of the versions that kick off the model year. Through calendar year 2022, GM reported that it's only delivered 855 Hummer EV trucks, including the one that it delivered in 2021. Reservations for the SUV are currently open, with production scheduled to begin later this year at GM's Factory Zero in Detroit.
