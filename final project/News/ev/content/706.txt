Ford has made 150,000 Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs Ford on Wednesday confirmed that it’s already produced 150,000 Mustang Mach-E electric crossovers. The milestone highlights how much Ford has already accelerated production of the popular electric vehicle. Ford executives originally suggested the Mustang Mach-E was bound for 25,000 to 30,000 U.S. sales annually, with a total achievable volume of 50,000 vehicles annually.  Ford made its first Mach-E delivery in December 2020.

In 2021, chief engineer Donna Dickson confirmed that Ford plans to pursue year-over-year range and efficiency improvements for the Mach-E for 2023 and 2024.

Ford also doubled F-150 Lightning production, to about 150,000 electric pickup trucks annually. Including its E-Transit electric vans and an upcoming EV for Europe to be built in Germany, Ford aims to make 600,000 EVs per year by the end of 2023 and 2 million in 2026.
