With its standard 90.6-kwh battery pack, the EQE 350+ will deliver 305 miles of range, according to EPA estimates cited by Mercedes-Benz but yet unconfirmed in official EPA listings.  The EQE is one of the closest electric products yet to the Tesla Model S in size, with length, width, and height all within an inch—although the EQE is a sedan whereas the Model S is a hatchback. The Model S now starts at $106,190. The Lucid Air Pure, starting at $88,900, is another U.S.-built rival very close in size and luxury intent. While the upcoming and related EQE SUV will be made in the U.S., the EQE sedan is made in Germany.  2023 Mercedes-Benz EQE 350+ In addition to the single-motor EQE 350+, the EQE lineup will be offered in dual-motor (all-wheel-drive) EQE 350 4Matic and EQE 500 4Matic versions—with the latter stepping up to 536 hp, versus the EQE 350's 288 hp.
