Inflation Reduction Act drastically cuts EV, plug-in hybrid models eligible for federal tax credit UPDATE: After you read this piece below, read about guidance from the IRS and DOE and which models are eligible for tax credit in 2022. With President Biden signing the Inflation Reduction Act on Tuesday, time is nearly up to get your purchase paperwork completed for a new EV or plug-in hybrid and still earn the federal tax credit.  While the revamped EV tax credit contained in the bill includes many top-level provisions that are likely to set the supply chain up for more American-made EVs soon, in the short term it will take away bottom-line money from many looking to purchase an EV or plug-in hybrid—and put some severe limitations on the number of choices you have in the market. The tax credit knocks out higher-priced and luxury EVs, with a cap of $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickups, and a cap of $55,000 for passenger cars. It also sets a maximum adjusted gross income (AGI) for those who can claim the credit, of $150,000 for single filers, $225,000 for heads of households, and $300,000 for joint filers.  2022 Rivian R1T There is an exception on the eve of the new rule, which starts as soon as Biden signs: A binding purchase contract will grandfather in the old qualification terms. Fisker may have had the right idea in tying up orders for its Ocean One launch edition recently. Fellow startup electric vehicle makers Rivian and Lucid are among several brands that have flexed the rules in recent days to help make more orders binding. The tax credit is almost certainly gone for the rest of 2022 and will be back at the beginning of 2023 for a smaller group of vehicles. Some domestic-content and supply-chain rules need guidance from the Treasury Department, and automakers will shift to more U.S.-sourced batteries and components, but this won’t happen overnight—or even in a year. In the meantime, we’ve looked at price and final assembly location—distilling the federal government’s current list of eligible vehicles in steps—as a starting point for getting a realistic idea of which vehicles will be eligible in calendar year 2023.
