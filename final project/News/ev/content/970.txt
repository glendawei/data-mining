VW shifts US CEO to lead Scout electric truck brand, aims for 25 EVs across US brands by 2030 Volkswagen has tapped its top U.S. executive to lead the newly established Scout brand, the automaker announced late Tuesday. Scott Keogh, who is president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, will become president and CEO of Scout, said the automaker, confirming again that the Scout brand will launch “all-electric pick-ups and rugged SUVs in the U.S. market.”  Pablo Di Si, who has led South American operations, will assume Keogh’s current position September 1. Volkswagen says that by the end of the decade, the VW Group now expects to offer 25 battery electric models in the U.S. That’s across all of its brands, which include VW, Audi, Porsche, and others. VW also says that the Group will build up its U.S. engineering, R&D, and supply chain around EVs.

Secondly, it’s likely Scout will not be a niche brand. The new brand has been moving quickly. In May, Scout was already reportedly looking for a U.S. factory site and aiming to incorporate commercial vehicles in its plan. Scout still has plenty of other questions left to answer, however—not just related to how its vehicles will be developed and whether they’ll be built on existing platforms, like MEB, but how they’ll be sold.
