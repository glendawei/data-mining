TE Connectivity and Harmonic Drive Systems join forces to improve cobot functionality TE Connectivity (TE) and Harmonic Drive Systems (HDS) are partnering to develop a new series of  HarmonicDrive gears equipped with a safety torque sensor that contributes to improving operational safety. HarmonicDrive gears are currently used in automation equipment, robotics and aerospace applications. The combination of TE’s high-performance safety torque sensor and HDS’s high-precision control speed reducer reportedly enables HarmonicDrive gears to deliver high-precision torque sensing, lightweight design, compactness and a spacious hollow structure.
TE shares in a press statement that through this collaboration, high reliability and safety can be achieved for collaborative robots as a result of the following key features: “The surging demand for collaborative robots makes safe operations around humans a must,” said John Tuley, global strategic customers director of TE Sensors. “By delivering heightened accuracy and speed, TE’s Safety Torque Sensors provide functional safety, paving the way for the next generation of human-robot collaboration.”
