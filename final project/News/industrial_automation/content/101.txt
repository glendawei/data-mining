Quantum technologies commercialization: NGen Canada and Digital Supercluster seek project proposals Next Generation Manufacturing Canada (NGen Canada) and Digital Supercluster have issued a joint call for project proposals for commercializing quantum technologies. This joint program focuses on quantum technologies including quantum sensors, networks and computing. NGen projects focused on the above categories must demonstrate the development and application of either: 1. Novel advanced manufacturing tools and techniques for quantum technologies (AM4Q) or 2. Quantum technologies to be deployed in manufacturing (Q4AM) DIGITAL projects will focus on commercial applications of quantum in safety and security, operations and logistics, and material and chemical discovery.
