Ontario government funds Bobaek America’s expansion into North American EV supply chain Bobaek America, a Korean electric vehicle (EV) parts manufacturer, is investing $35 million to build a new manufacturing facility in Windsor, specializing in battery insulation panels and cell sheets for EVs. As part of this investment, the Ontario government is providing $1.5 million in funding through the Regional Development Program’s Southwestern Ontario Development Fund. The new, 71,000-square-foot manufacturing facility is expected to open in June 2024. It will reportedly include state-of-the-art equipment to produce the insulation panels and cell sheets needed for EV batteries, including pressure moulding and sensor cutting machines, tape assembly, silicon pad cutting and packing automation lines and 3D measuring equipment. Bobaek’s investment marks the company’s first entry into the North American EV supply chain and will create 144 new jobs in the region. “We are pleased to announce that Bobaek is establishing its first North American manufacturing hub in Windsor, Ontario,” said Dongjo Seo, president of Bobaek C&S headquarters. “The plant’s output should be able to cover the entire North American market. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to all the individuals who have provided much assistance in enabling us to settle in Windsor.” “Our government continues to build up Ontario’s auto and manufacturing sectors by creating the right conditions to attract multi-national companies,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “With support from the province’s Regional Development Program, Bobaek’s investment will serve as a critical link in building our end-to-end EV and battery supply chain, affirming Ontario’s position as a leader in building the cars of the future. Thank you, Bobaek for choosing Ontario as your launchpad into the North American market.”
