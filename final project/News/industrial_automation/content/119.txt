International Federation of Robotics launches Go4Robotics campaign The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) recently launched its Go4Robotics campaign with a focus on robots for everyone. In a press statement, IFR  shared that as technology advances, robotics is becoming an increasingly important tool across industries to enhance efficiency, productivity and safety in the workplace. In many parts of the world, labour shortages, missing skilled labour and rising labour costs are further drivers for automation solutions, says the organization. With its new campaign go4robotics, IFR wants to help SMEs on their automation journey and provide valuable information on the exciting field of robotics. Whether one’s interested in automation solutions, cobots, autonomous mobile robots or automated guided vehicles, the IFR campaign is designed to provide the latest news, trends and expertise in the world of robotics. In its Expertise Center, one can reportedly discover the latest trends, stay up-to-date with the latest developments and innovations in robotics with numerous free articles, whitepapers and e-books on deep dive topics. IFR explains in its statement that while the trend of “democratizing” robotics opens up new customer segments, many companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are still doubtful whether robotics is also the right solution in their specific situation. They expect automation to be expensive, elaborate and complex. However, IFR notes, small-scale automation is a highly beneficial option at lower costs. Partial automation boosts productivity without incurring high costs, optimizing
processes and thus relieving the strain on staff. This becomes more and more important, as SMEs have to compete on a global level and customer requirements are on the rise, too. Customers today demand greater flexibility, more product variants and smaller batch sizes.
