On a quarterly basis, total sales fell 0.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023, mainly on lower sales in the petroleum and coal product (-8.1 percent) and primary metal (-8.9 percent) subsectors. Year over year, total sales decreased 1.4 percent in June. Total sales in constant dollars declined one percent in June, indicating a lower volume of goods sold, as per the report. The report states that many auto manufacturing plants increased their production in June and operated at a higher production capacity, leading to an 11.4 percent increase in sales of motor vehicles to $5.6 billion, the highest level since June 2019. On a quarterly basis, motor vehicle sales were up 8.1 percent in the second quarter of 2023, the third consecutive quarterly gain. Sales of motor vehicle parts, however, declined 6.8 percent in June.

In Quebec, sales rose one percent to $17.7 billion in June, on higher sales of primary metals as well as chemical products. The report notes that despite the gain in total manufacturing sales in Quebec in June, sales in Montréal fell 2.1 percent on lower production of aerospace products and parts (-6.6 percent), while Québec posted an 8.1 percent decline due to lower sales of petroleum and coal products. Total inventory levels edged up 0.3 percent to $123.2 billion in June, on higher inventories in nine of 21 subsectors, driven by higher inventories of aerospace products and parts (+3.3 percent) and chemicals (+2.5 percent).
