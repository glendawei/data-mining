Empowering skilled trades: Government of Canada’s strategic investment The Government of Canada is investing in the skilled trades to ensure Canadians have access to the high-quality apprenticeship training they need to get into good, in-demand and well-paying skilled trade careers. As part of the Canadian Apprenticeship Strategy, the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages, Randy Boissonnault, launched this year’s call for proposals, which will provide over $25 million exclusively in the 2023-24 fiscal year for projects to support approximately 25,500 apprentices. Unions representing Red Seal workers are eligible to apply. For this year only, organizations managing training trust funds for Red Seal workers, community colleges, technical institutions and training providers that deliver technical training to apprentices as part of a curriculum for a Red Seal trade will also be able to apply. This is to ensure as many Canadians as possible can access training that will help them find a good job in the skilled trades. Applications from unions will be prioritized in the assessment process. Selected projects will reportedly help improve the quality of training for apprentices through the purchase of equipment and materials and support the development of environmental skills in the Red Seal trades. The deadline to apply for funding is September 21, 2023.
