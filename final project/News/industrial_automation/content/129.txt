TRUMPF fires mega laser to celebrate 100th anniversary in style TRUMPF is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The specialists in lasers decided to fire a powerful show laser to celebrate the occasion. The laser light shone for the first time on the evening of August 3. Under the right weather conditions, the laser was visible up to 50 miles away. The company explains in a press statement that the green laser light is produced by a particularly energy-efficient laser with three kilowatts of power. Show lasers are not part of TRUMPF’s core business, so its customers would normally use this kind of system for tasks such as welding electric vehicle batteries. The company ships its lasers to industrial companies all over the world. The semiconductor industry, the automotive industry and the medical-device sector are some of the many areas in which the company’s lasers play a role. Alongside its laser business, TRUMPF also offers machine tools for flexible sheet-metal fabrication. This is the business in which the company originally made a name for itself. This year marks the achievement of a major milestone. In 1923, Christian Trumpf and two partners acquired the mechanical workshops previously occupied by Julius Geiger GmbH in Stuttgart. This laid the foundations for the company, which from 1937 operated under the name TRUMPF. From the mid-1930s, TRUMPF specialized in the production of manual machinery for simple sheet-metal processing tasks. In the 1950s, the company’s focus shifted to stationary machine tools. As early as 1985, the company launched its first own laser, laying the foundation for its rise as a laser expert. Today, the TRUMPF also provides solutions for technologies that hold the key to the future, such as e-mobility and the EUV lithography systems used to produce cutting-edge computer chips.
