Inductive Automation launches Alliance Partner Program, names first partner companies Inductive Automation has launched its Alliance Partner Program, an opportunity for companies to showcase and co-market services and solution offerings that pair well with the Ignition industrial application platform. As part of the launch, Inductive Automation (IA) has named the program’s first partner companies – Amazon Web Services (AWS), Belden, Plantformance and Stratus. Partners involved with the Alliance Partner Program will work closely with the company’s Industry & Education Engagement team to specifically discuss co-marketing opportunities. Alliance Partners will be listed on Inductive Automation’s designated webpage and will be required to list Inductive Automation, its logo and website link on the Alliance Partner’s website appropriately and in accordance with specific brand usage guidelines. “This is a great opportunity to highlight the ecosystem that has organically developed around Ignition. The Alliance Partner Program’s goal is to broaden awareness of both the partner and Inductive Automation through co-marketing activities, showing how our joint solution provides a better together story for our collective customers,” says David Grussenmeyer, Industry and Education Engagement manager at the company. The Alliance Partner Program is Inductive Automation’s latest partner program. Each IA partner program has a unique focus. In the Strategic Partner Program, which currently includes Cirrus Link Solutions, strategically aligned third-party software providers create modules in their area of expertise and sell them directly through IA. In the Solution Partner Program, IA highlights hardware, software, and service providers who offer solutions and technologies that are powered by Ignition. The new Alliance Partner Program is focused on showcasing a select group of technology companies providing valuable products and services that complement Ignition.
