Increased robotics adoption accelerates machine vision systems market: ARC Advisory Group A new ARC Advisory Group research on the Machine Vision Systems market reveals that demand for 3D machine vision systems has accelerated with the growing adoption of robotics in a wide range of industries. Integration of vision systems with industrial robots increases the flexibility and efficiency of robotic tasks. 3D vision systems have expanded the possibilities for vision-guided robots in applications such as bin picking, product profiling, and tracking. This enables automation of more industrial tasks such as material handling, assembly and inspection. The technology reportedly delivers accurate real-time location data, enabling robots to be more independent, flexible and adapt to changes. “Robotic solutions address the seemingly insatiable demand in manufacturing to increase flexibility, improve productivity, and employ human operators only in tasks where they can add the most value. The demand for robotics has diversified across a broader range of industries. Machine vision systems are employed in a robot for recognizing and viewing objects. 3D machine vision in conjunction with robotics provides guidance and location for a wide range of assembly and inspection applications. Powerful cameras, faster vision processors, and advanced software have allowed robots to complete more than one task without reprogramming,” according to Anju Ajaykumar, senior Analyst and key author of ARC’s machine vision systems market research. In addition to providing detailed competitive market share data, the report also addresses key market trends such as robotics, vision with AI-driven edge technology, Li-on battery production, embedded vision,  deep learning, cloud-based vision and 3D imaging.
