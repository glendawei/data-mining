CME hopeful for B.C. port strike resolution; calls for federal government to hold parties accountable Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME) shared in a recent press statement that it is hopeful the B.C. ports labour dispute is resolved after a tentative agreement has been reached between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Canada (ILWU) and the BC Maritime Employers Association (BCMEA). The association notes that the situation is costing Canadian manufacturers an average of $207,000 per day. Manufacturers cannot afford any more disruption to the west coast ports. CME is urging the federal government to hold the parties accountable to ensure swift ratification of the new deal. It adds that if the tentative deal is not successfully concluded by both parties, the federal government should recall Parliament to bring in back-to-work legislation to get our goods moving again. The original 13-day strike, followed by the unsettled strike situation this week, has severely impacted manufacturing, the Canadian economy, and the country’s global reputation as a reliable place to do business, says CME. It reiterates its call for reforms that would make critical transportation infrastructure, like ports, essential so that it is possible to create the predictability and stability that all manufacturers need. “We are closely watching the situation and remain hopeful for a successful resolution,” says Dennis Darby, president and CEO of CME. “However, manufacturers and our economy cannot continue to withstand these disruptions that are severely impacting our sector. We need the federal government to seriously consider measures to ensure stability in manufacturing.”
