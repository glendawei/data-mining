Ontario offers $5 million investment support to Fort Erie manufacturer Fort Erie manufacturer Siltech Corporation is investing $100 million to build a new 210,000-square-foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. The Ontario government welcomes this major investment by the manufacturer of specialty silicone used in the personal care, automotive, agriculture, pulp and paper and oil and gas industries. The investment to build the new manufacturing facility in Fort Erie will create 51 good-paying jobs. “As we continue to grow the manufacturing sector in our province, we’re thrilled to see Ontario companies like Siltech invest in their expansion,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “We’re creating the conditions for long-term economic growth that will create more good jobs and opportunities for workers and businesses across the province. Congratulations, Siltech, on this exciting project, and thank you for choosing Ontario and contributing to our province’s dynamic and growing manufacturing sector.” Siltech’s new facility will be the company’s third one in the province. The facility will include new state-of-the-art technology to increase production and help the company meet growing demand and expand to new markets around the world. As part of this investment to expand operations, the government is providing $5 million in funding through the Regional Development Program’s Southwestern Ontario Development Fund. “Siltech is excited to be building in Fort Erie,” said Dag Enhorning, president of Siltech. “We are a proud Canadian company and look forward to many years of growth in this community.”
