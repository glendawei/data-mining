Three New Larger Size BXR-LE Brakes for Mobile Robots  Efficient power-saving braking for mobile robots is critical to minimize battery charging downtime. The new larger size Miki Pulley (Plymouth, MN) BXR-LE brakes are ideal for factories and similar applications using mobile robots. These new BXR-LE brakes provide exact sequential motion and timed positioning. They apply holding torque after the motor joint stops and provide dynamic braking in the event of an emergency, such as a power interruption. Additionally: These Miki Pulley brakes are a cost-effective safety device for all types of mobile robots including cobot systems. They are a positive “halt and hold” device to mitigate potential mechanical damage to an automated system. www.mikipulley-us.com, 800-533-1731
