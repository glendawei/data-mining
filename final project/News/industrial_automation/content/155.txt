Ontario supports nearly $40M manufacturing investment in Brantford facility The Ontario government is supporting a $39.9 million investment by Numesh, a Canadian manufacturer of welded steel wire and wire mesh used for concrete reinforcement. As part of this investment to expand Numesh’s operations to Ontario, the government is providing $2.9 million in funding through the Regional Development Program’s Southwestern Ontario Development Fund. “With the support of the Ontario government and the Regional Development Program, Numesh’s growth will positively impact the overall Ontario economy and the southwestern community by creating new skilled and sustainable jobs,” said Charles Thibault, chief executive and national general manager at Numesh. “Safety, well-being and respect will be at the center of the working environment. Numesh will continue to lead the industry of welded wire mesh and remain the backbone of new construction projects while supporting local contractors and distributors with their competitive environment.” Numesh’s $39.9 million investment will be used to expand to Ontario by transferring some of the company’s existing business in Quebec. The new facility in Brantford will have innovative, state-of-the-art equipment and technology that will also increase production to help the company meet growing demand and better serve customers in Ontario, Western Canada and the North Central U.S. The investment, for a new facility in Brantford, will create 56 new good-paying jobs. “Ontario is known worldwide for our excellence in manufacturing, and we’re thrilled to welcome Numesh to Brantford, where they will boost local manufacturing and create good-paying jobs,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “We continue to create the right conditions to attract investments from both global and domestic companies. Thank you, Numesh, for choosing Ontario.”
