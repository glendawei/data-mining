Nokian Tyres Announces Huge Expansion in Tennessee Tire manufacturer Nokian Tyres last week announced a massive 350,000 square-foot addition to its production campus in Dayton, Tennessee.  MI-based BC Construction broke ground earlier this month and construction has begun on a warehouse capable of holding up to 600,000 tires.  Nokian is on pace to double production in Dayton, making up to four million tires per year by 2024.  This year, the company will add light truck tires to its product mix of all-season and all-weather tires.  The Finnish tiremaker is also adding some 125 jobs, bringing its U.S. footprint close to 500 employees.  Automation will play a key role, with automated conveyors delivering tires from the factory to the warehouse via an overhead bridge between buildings.  The tires will be automatically stacked into steel storage racks at the warehouse without being touched by hand.  Nokian Tyres opened its Dayton Factory in fall 2019, production began in early 2020.  Nokianâ€™s Dayton factory is the only tire production facility in the world to possess LEED v4 Silver certification, according to the company.   The administration building is LEED v4 Gold-certified and fully powered by energy generated from onsite solar panels.
