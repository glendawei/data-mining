Securing OT and industrial control systems: ISA and NEMA sign MOU for cybersecurity The International Society of Automation (ISA) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) in the U.S. signed a memorandum of understanding to promote cybersecurity standards and practices for operation technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS), specifically the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards. ISA explains in a press statement that this partnership aims to boost policies that reference the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards in the establishment of codes, incentives and mandates for cybersecurity OT/ICS automation and systems. OT and ICS enable the functionality of numerous manufacturing processes, especially in the production of critical infrastructure components. “NEMA and ISA realize the urgent need to promote the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards,” said Patrick Hughes, senior vice-president of technical and industry affairs at NEMA. “This MOU will bring greater recognition of and reliance upon these critical OT cybersecurity standards that have been developed by ISA, the leading professional society for automation.” Developed by ISA and recognized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the series of standards offers practicable guidance and resources to protect critical infrastructure and the supply chain. Particular priorities for the team include: “We are excited about this partnership with NEMA, which will allow the reach and awareness of ISA/IEC 62443 that ISA has already achieved to grow even further,” said Andre Ristaino, managing director, global consortia and conformity assessment, at ISA. “NEMA’s commitment to supply chain resilience and expertise in outreach and advocacy makes the organization an excellent partner for ISA.”
