U.S. Air Force Receives First of 100 New Bomb Disposal Robots L3Harris Technologies today announced delivery of the first of more than 100 T7 explosive ordnance disposal robots to the U.S. Air Force as part of a contract supporting the USAF’s global EOD mission. The initial four-robot delivery represents the first of 56 T7 robotic systems, support, maintenance and training provided under an $85 million, 10-year, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract awarded in September 2021. In May 2022 the USAF requested 51 additional T7 robots, for a total of 107 robots ordered to date. “The world’s most capable robot for challenging EOD tasks where speed and precision are required, the T7 will help safeguard Air Force EOD operators as they mitigate explosive threats around the globe,” said Ed Zoiss, President, Space and Airborne Systems, L3Harris. “We’re keenly aware of what’s at stake for these operators and constantly refine and enhance our robotic systems to minimize risk and maximize utility during these dangerous, no-fail missions.” Recognized by the USAF for its outstanding technical and usability ratings, the T7 represents a major upgrade for the USAF from its 20-year-old robotic fleet. The T7 enables operators to handle larger explosive devices in less time and provides increased speed, improved lift, reach strength, and extended battery life. Additionally, a unique haptic controller provides human-like dexterity and mission-critical precision. In 2021, L3Harris completed delivery of 122 T7 robots to the U.K. Ministry of Defense to replace its aging fleet of remote-controlled EOD vehicles. With the current USAF contract calling for L3Harris to provide up to 170 robots, these contracts make L3Harris the largest robot supplier for the U.K. MOD and the USAF.
