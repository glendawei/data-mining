Cleaning Robot Branded 'Useless' by Hospital Staff Staff at a hospital in England have turned on a robot that was brought into clean floors and entertain guests with songs and jokes.  Employees at the Darent Valley Hospital in Kent told the Daily Mail that the 4-foot robot doesn’t clean very well and continually bumps into people.  The robot is one of four designed by Lionsbot. The others are built to scrub, mop and tow items.  The robots were brought in by Medirest, a private company contracted to handle catering, security and cleaning for NHS hospitals.  The vacuum robot has blue eyes, approximately 10 hours of battery life and it operates with less noise than conventional vacuum cleaners.  Medirest told the publication the robot is used during off hours or during less busy times to minimize disruption.  However, staff have said it’s tough to get around it in hallways, labeled it “useless at vacuuming,” and it’s only there so people can take selfies with it.   Despite this robot’s minimal success, many other robots have proved useful in medical settings for tasks including surgery and lab work.
