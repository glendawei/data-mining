Calculating ROI for Automation Projects When  manufacturers turn to intelligent automation resources, such as robotic process  automation and LoCode platforms, their main goal is typically to lower costs by  automating manual tasks, enabling them to reallocate resources and reassign  employees to more meaningful work. On  the surface, this sounds like it should be easy enough to track. Many companies  simply calculate return on their automation investment by estimating the cost  for building out a new automation, the cost to maintain that automation, and  then the estimated time savings provided by automating what was once a manual  task. While  this may appear to be a fairly straightforward approach, there are several  factors which can complicate this seemingly simple formula. Here are six  factors manufacturers should always consider when trying to determine ROI on  intelligent automation projects. These  and other factors – including a reduction in manual errors and increases in  productivity – need to be considered by manufacturers when calculating ROI for  an intelligent automation project. If they are not accurately assessed at the  beginning of a project, they will always find a way to eventually surface,  bringing with them added costs which ultimately undermine the ROI that was  originally calculated.
