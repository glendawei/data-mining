Digi-Key Electronics, Siemens to Host Webinar on Reliable Power Supplies for Automation and Control Systems THIEF RIVER FALLS, Minn. – Digi-Key Electronics will host a webinar in collaboration with Siemens on March 8 at 11 a.m. CST about power reliability for automation and control systems. The webinar will be presented by Greg Kateb, SITOP power product consultant for Siemens. The webinar will cover:  The operation of any control or automation system relies on stable and uninterrupted power to all components – in a single machine or an entire plant. Kateb will address a variety of scenarios that a power system might face, such as short circuit at an end device, unusually high current draw due to device malfunction, blips caused by brown outs and other disturbances in the incoming AC feed, and more. “Efficient and reliable power supply is the most basic requirement for operating any system, and particularly in automation and control settings,” said Eric Halvorson, partnership marketing manager for Digi-Key. “This webinar will guide engineers in our community on how to avoid faults that could disrupt manufacturing processes and result in unexpected expenses and costly delays.” Kateb has more than 15 years of experience as an engineer and consultant in critical power applications for both commercial and industrial installations. He specializes in Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) and battery technologies along low voltage distribution. “I’m excited to highlight how incredibly reliable SITOP low-voltage power supplies are,” Kateb said. “They feature a compact design and powerful performance, and can ensure continued supply of clean and uninterrupted power to control or automation systems.” To attend the webinar, submit a registration form. If you can't attend the live webinar, Digi-Key will send the recording after the event to those who register. The webinar will be presented in English.
