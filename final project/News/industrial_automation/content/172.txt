GM’s $280 million investment to boost next-generation truck production at Oshawa Assembly General Motors (GM) is investing $280 million in its Oshawa Assembly facility to produce the next-generation internal combustion engine (ICE) full-size trucks. This investment builds on GM’s commitment to Canadian manufacturing, which includes more than $1.2 billion invested in the Oshawa plant in 2020, says the company in a press statement. “We are excited to announce additional investment for our Oshawa plant to support production of the next-generation of full-size pickups,” said Marissa West, president and managing director of GM Canada. “Oshawa Assembly plays a critical role in meeting customer demand for GM’s popular full-size trucks, helping GM lead the Canadian industry in heavy-duty truck sales in 2022 and take an early lead in total truck sales for 2023. Today, we are proud to say we will continue to build pickups with Oshawa pride for years to come.” Two years ago, Oshawa Assembly reportedly delivered one of the fastest plant launches in GM history. Since it reopened, GM Canada has created 2,600 new manufacturing jobs and thousands of indirect jobs at Canadian suppliers. Production has increased to three shifts, and fifty percent of new production hires at the Oshawa plant are women. “What this investment will do is significant for workers and families across Oshawa and the Durham region,” said Lana Payne, Unifor National President. “By building the next generation of truck products thousands of jobs and the plant’s footprint will be secured for years to come. Continuing to invest in Oshawa autoworkers makes sense now and in the future. The skills, hard work, and dedication of Unifor autoworkers are what fuels Canada’s economic engine and builds world-class vehicles used every day all over the world.”
