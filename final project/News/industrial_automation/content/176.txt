Major milestone: Rockwell Automation attains highest level IEC product security certification Rockwell Automation recently achieved Maturity Level 4 of the globally recognized International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)  62443-4-1 industrial cybersecurity certification, the highest level. Certification of the Rockwell Automation SDL was performed independently by TÜV Rheinland. According to a press statement from the company, this certification by the IEC, a global, not-for-profit membership organization that assesses the needs for standards across various industrial applications, demonstrates its continued commitment to security. It represents the strong practices and protocols in place globally to bring secure solutions to the company’s customers. Maturity Level 4 recognizes the highly mature and ubiquitously deployed cybersecurity practices used around the world. In general, the IEC 62443-4-1 standard defines a secure development lifecycle (SDL) for the purpose of developing and maintaining products that are secure by design, used in industrial automation and control systems. “Cybersecurity continues to be top of mind for customers around the world. The IEC 62443 series of standards and certifications allow for customers to make more informed decisions when sourcing, designing, and building their industrial automation and information solutions,” said Tony Baker, vice-president and chief product security officer at Rockwell Automation. “These standards provide customers with confidence that the technologies were designed with security in mind, provide the appropriate security controls to secure their application, and that Rockwell Automation will provide ongoing security support throughout the products’ useful life.” Rockwell Automation has achieved numerous milestones in recent years in cybersecurity including:
