Automate to continue as an annual event; 2024-25 dates announced The Automate show will be an annual event, according to the show’s organizer Association for Advancing Automation (A3). A3 shared in a press statement that the North American robotics and automation trade show will be annual due to overwhelming demand. Automate will take place at McCormick Place in Chicago from May 6 to 9 in 2024 and will be back in Detroit in 2025 from May 12 to 15. Automate had historically been held every other year. According to A3, it saw extraordinary support and participation in back-to-back shows in 2022 and 2023. This year’s Automate in Detroit featured more than 750 exhibits, covering more than 300,000 square feet, with 25,000 registrants. “Over the past several show cycles, Automate has grown substantially,” said Jeff Burnstein, president of A3. “What’s more, the pace of change in automation is staggering – attendees and exhibitors alike asked that we increase our frequency to an annual show to help keep them ahead of the curve.” A3 explains in its statement that as automation touches every aspect of our world, the show is more important than ever for engineers of all industries and people of all professional backgrounds – from the production floor, kitchen, field and construction site all the way to the boardroom. Automate is a show where attendees see solutions for varied applications and industry. The Automate 2024 show will be free to attend for anyone interested in, or who works with automation. Attendees will see the latest in cutting-edge robotics, machine vision, artificial intelligence, motion control and related automation technologies. In conjunction with the free show, the paid Automate Conference will feature over 150 talks from top industry experts. Conference attendees can also take advantage of professional certification opportunities.
