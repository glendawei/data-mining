RS introduces annual subscription options for DesignSpark, providing more choice for engineers RS has introduced annual subscription options for DesignSpark, its online community for engineers. According to the company, this will deliver more choice for businesses to decide how they want to pay to gain access to DesignSpark’s suite of design tools and resources. DesignSpark offers a suite of design tools, including DesignSpark Mechanical and DesignSpark PCB, plus comprehensive 2D/3D and electronics part libraries and a host of design resources, such as technology articles, projects and community forums. In April 2023, RS reportedly introduced three subscription levels for DesignSpark, payable via monthly subscription, which offered more benefits to users at a low cost. DesignSpark Explorer, DesignSpark Creator and DesignSpark Engineer provide different levels of access to tools and design resources, enabling members to select the best option according to their requirements. Introduced this month, the newly available annual fee will be $143.88 for Creator and $215.88 for Engineer, while Explorer remains free to users. In addition, DesignSpark is offering a five percent discount until the end of December 202 to any user or business that signs up for a 12-month period. “As always, we listen very carefully and react positively to customer feedback,” said Mike Bray, vice-president of Innovation and DesignSpark at RS. “Since the introduction of Explorer, Creator, and Engineer earlier this year, it quickly became clear that many users wanted the option of an annual subscription. Right at the beginning, flexibility was built into our vision and approach for DesignSpark. So, we have introduced this new option for businesses, organizations, and individuals to make it easier for them to gain access to the advanced, yet low-cost tooling offered by DesignSpark.”
