ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance unveils its new website The ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) has launched its new website, available at www.isagca.org. ISAGCA is a collaborative forum to advance operational technology (OT) cybersecurity awareness, education, readiness, standardization and knowledge sharing. As an industry voice in OT cybersecurity and source of the ISA/IEC 62443 standards, the International Society of Automation (ISA) established ISAGCA to address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that are clear and present dangers to facilities, processes and the safety of communities around the world. The new website reportedly presents the multiple ways that ISAGCA conducts its work, including: “We believe that cybersecurity merits recognition as a fundamental workplace tenet alongside functionality, efficiency and safety. ISAGCA is our community’s forum where companies who are normally competitors have a safe place to collaborate to make this change a reality. I am honoured to unveil our new website that reflects the importance of this work,” said Andre Ristaino, ISA managing director of global consortia and conformance programs. The new site also offers free resources to help stakeholders better understand the landscape of cybersecurity for industrial automation and control systems, the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards and how to apply standards and conformance programs within OT environments. “When the International Society of Automation (ISA) launched ISAGCA in 2019, we started with six founding members and a huge goal: to transform the way industry identifies and manages cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities,” said Ristaino. “Today, I am proud that more than 50 companies have joined our efforts to elevate OT cybersecurity from an art, to a science, to an engineering discipline.”
