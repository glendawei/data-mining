Comau collaborates with LiNa Energy to automate solid-state sodium batteries manufacturing Comau is partnering with LiNa to design a scalable automated manufacturing solution for solid-state sodium-metal-chloride battery cells. Comau shares in a press statement that through simultaneous engineering, the team has finalized a concept design, allowing LiNa to automate its battery production process. The companies intend to validate the sustainable, safe and efficient oxygen-free dry box environment as a step towards larger-scale manufacturing. Comau and LiNa engineers worked in tandem to design the enclosure and handling equipment for the specific components of the solid-state battery cell as well as to identify and integrate existing commercially available equipment. Comau’s cleanroom classified, high-speed Racer-5 Sensitive Environments articulated robots are added to the design. This collaborative approach enabled Comau to suggest modifications to LiNa’s existing manufacturing methodology to optimize process dynamics in the move to automatic cell assembly. Comau has reportedly provided LiNa with a detailed technology roadmap to automate its innovative cell manufacturing process. “This automated manufacturing concept, designed with Comau’s engineering team, provides a clear technology roadmap to significantly increase production capacity of our patented battery cells,” said Kris Barr, director of operations. “Having successfully researched the process dynamics and finalized an innovative design proposal, we are looking forward to taking the next steps in our mission to commercialize our sustainable, low-cost solid-state sodium batteries.”
