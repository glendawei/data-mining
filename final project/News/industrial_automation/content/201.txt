Teledyne DALSA announces a new line scan camera is now in production Teledyne DALSA’s new Linea2 4k Multispectral 5GigE line scan camera is now in production. The company shared in a press statement that this new camera offers a 5GigE interface with five times the bandwidth of the Linea GigE camera. Teledyne adds that the Linea2 4k Multispectral 5GigE simultaneously captures high-resolution RGB plus Near Infrared (NIR) multispectral images to reveal invisible features that cannot be detected using visible lighting alone. Reportedly, this makes it suitable for identifying hard-to-see defects, contaminants and security features in applications such as automated optical inspection, printing inspection, optical sorting systems, material grading and inspection, web inspection and many other machine vision applications. Packed into a small form factor, this camera is powered by Teledyne’s high-performance quadlinear CMOS sensor with a 4,096 x 4 pixel resolution and 7 x 7 μm pixel size. There are four sensor rows for red, green, blue, and NIR channels, with spectrally independent colour and NIR outputs for minimal crosstalk.
