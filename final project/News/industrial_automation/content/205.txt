PTDA and BSA add new product categories to the PIE Technology Platform The Power Transmission Distributors Association (PTDA) and Bearing Specialists Association (BSA) announced the introduction of two new product categories, belt drives and bearing accessories and tools, to the PIE Technology Platform (PIE). PIE is a cloud-based platform giving manufacturers and distributors of industrial products access to a comprehensive catalogue for the exchange of content product information. PTDA notes in a press statement that PIE is an essential tool for channel partners providing efficient and seamless communication of accurate, real-time information, strengthening collaboration and advancing e-commerce sales. PIE ensures end customers have access to accurate and reliable product information. Belt drives is the first power transmissions product category introduced to the platform. With the addition of bearing accessories and tools, the total number of PIE categories is now 24. Chains and sprockets, iron sheaves, linear bearings and seals are also expected to launch this year. An additional nine categories are planned, including brushing/hub fixes, shaft couplings, conveyors and material handling, gearing, adjustable speed drives, motor/motion control, clutches and brakes and motors. With 24/7/365 access to PIE-compliant manufacturer partner content, distributors can map product data to their company-specific PIM system website or end-user digital communication using an automated tool. The single, secure and standard platform is only accessible to authorized distributor partners. PTDA explains that this ensures manufacturers can protect and maintain product data ownership.
