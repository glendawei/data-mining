ABB completes Siemens low voltage NEMA motor business acquisition ABB has completed its acquisition of the Siemens low voltage NEMA motor business. The company had announced its intention to acquire this business in August 2022. The acquisition of this business is part of ABBâ€™s growth strategy for its motion business area. ABB notes in a press statement that this move strengthens its position as an industrial NEMA motor manufacturer, and it provides an even stronger platform from which ABB can better serve its global customers. The line of horizontal and vertical induction severe duty and general purpose motors will be re-branded as ABB and reintroduced to the market during the second quarter of 2023. ABB further shares that the global NEMA motor industry, roughly $2.7 billion in size, comprises industrial electric motors primarily used within North America.
