Siemens and Amazon Web Services collaborate to simplify IT and OT integration Siemens and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are reportedly collaborating to simplify IT and OT integration. Siemens shares in a press statement that AWS IoT SiteWise Edge is now available on the Siemens Industrial Edge Marketplace. From there, customers can reportedly deploy it on Siemens Industrial Edge for centralized app and device management and combine it with a variety of other apps and edge devices, from Siemens and other vendors, to configure an IoT solution for their specific challenges. AWS IoT SiteWise Edge is an on-premises software that is part of the Industrial IoT services portfolio of AWS. It can collect, process and monitor equipment data locally, even without an internet connection. This collaboration between AWS and Siemens reportedly aims to accelerate the creation and deployment of Industrial IoT applications at scale that work seamlessly across the edge and the cloud by bringing data collection and processing closer to the machine and helping streamline data pipelines into the cloud.
