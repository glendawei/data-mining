PTDA to host its 2023 Canadian conference in June The Power Transmission Distributors Association (PTDA) will host the PTDA 2023 Canadian Conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from June 6 to 8. Delegates in the power transmission and motion control (PT/MC) industry, representing PTDA distributor and manufacturer companies, will be in attendance to broaden cross-channel networks, expand connections and deepen business relationships. “We’re proud of the relationships our U.S. and Canadian channel partners have built,” says PTDA president Mike McLain, Allied Bearing and Supply. “The Canadian Conference creates additional pathways for company and industry growth and profitability. There is a great opportunity for attendees to network, hear about important market trend updates and learn how best to support their workforce.” The association explains in a press statement that both manufacturer and distributor executives appreciate the conference’s Distributor-Manufacturer Idea Exchange (DM-IDEX) as an excellent face-to-face cross-channel business program with a measurable ROI. For the first time, the DM-IDEX will take place over two days and include both short- and long-form meetings. The latter will allow time for a deeper discussion of business ventures, market strategies and issues. Industry thought leaders and speakers expected to participate in the event include the following. The association has also set aside time for receptions, group meals and golf to ensure that attendees have ample opportunities for informal networking throughout the conference.
