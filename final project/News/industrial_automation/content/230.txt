Burloak Technologies receives ISO 17025 for its materials testing lab Burloak Technologies received ISO 17025 accreditation for its Oakville materials testing lab. The company explains in a press statement that the ISO standard outlines general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. Burloak Technologies has secured accreditation for ISO 17025 for various testing, as well as NADCAP in the areas of Tensile testing (AC7101/3), Hardness testing (AC7102/5) and Metallography testing (AC7101/4). This successful accreditation demonstrates both the technical competence and quality management system of Burloak’s materials testing lab, states the company. “The company’s growing list of certifications and accreditations differentiate us in the North American market, where very few AM companies possess both Nadcap and ISO 17025 accreditation,” said Jason Ball, vice-president and general manager of Burloak Technologies. “This means that we can now source metal powder, build AM components and heat treat them in accordance with Nadcap, and then test the products in our materials lab in accordance with ISO 17025 – all in-house. This will not only enable faster turnaround time but also ensure the highest standards of quality for our customers.” Burloak adds in its statement that this milestone was made possible through the strong commitment of its materials lab team and talented co-op students from three of Canada’s top universities – all working together to prepare for and participate in the successful audit.
