NGen announces $35M advanced manufacturing fund; invites project proposals Next Generation Manufacturing Canada (NGen) is issuing a call for advanced manufacturing project proposals. The Global Innovation Cluster for Advanced Manufacturing will co-invest $35 million of federal funds along with industry contributions to launch $95 million worth of new innovation projects across Canada. NGen will support collaborative, business-led projects that are aimed at de-risking, commercializing, and scaling-up innovative manufacturing capabilities in Canada. “With an existing portfolio of over 165 projects valued at $585 million and a growing network across the country, NGen is excited to launch its first call for proposals with renewed Federal funding”, said John Laughlin, CTO of NGen. “This non-dilutive funding represents a significant addition to Canada’s innovation toolkit. It represents a key investment to help our best and brightest companies grow and be well positioned in the competitive global market”. NGen explains in a press statement that advanced digital, materials and production technologies are helping manufacturers respond to and take advantage of shifting market dynamics by improving existing production and business processes and scaling up the production and commercialization of new products and services. Integration of technologies, including solutions that streamline technology used for manufacturing, are important next steps for many Canadian manufacturers. NGen is inviting Canadian manufacturers and technology providers to assemble project consortia that will support the development, scale-up and adoption of new and transformative advanced manufacturing processes that can be commercialized in Canada and around the world. NGen will prioritize projects that will result in world-leading advanced manufacturing capabilities.
