Annual Rockwell smart manufacturing study highlights impact of technology on success Rockwell Automation released the results of its eighth annual “State of Smart Manufacturing Report.” The global study surveyed more than 1,350 manufacturers across 13 major manufacturing countries. The 2023 report reveals a focus on delivering profitable growth without sacrificing quality, an emphasis on accessing data’s true potential and increasing adoption of technology to build resilience, enable agility, increase sustainability and address workforce challenges. “Manufacturers are continuing to seek opportunities for profitable growth but are realizing that uncertainty in workforce availability is impacting quality, along with their ability to meet evolving customer needs,” said Veena Lakkundi, senior vice-president of corporate strategy and development at Rockwell Automation. “The survey found that smart manufacturing technology is enabling manufacturers of all sizes to optimize more resilient, agile, and sustainable solutions that accelerate transformation. If we’ve learned anything from history, it’s that organizations that invest in innovation, with a bias for action, during times of uncertainty can outpace competitors.” Based on the survey findings, technology is crucial to mitigating risk and delivering growth. However, for one-third of manufacturers, the range of available systems and platforms is leading to “technology paralysis” – an inability to decide between solutions. Manufacturers can overcome this indecision by choosing a partner with relevant industry expertise and experience who can advise and guide them in implementing a fit-for-purpose solution to achieve desired outcomes. The full findings of the report can be found here.
