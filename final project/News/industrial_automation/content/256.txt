Rockwell Automation strategically invests in READY Robotics Rockwell Automation is strategically investing in READY Robotics, a company specializing in software-defined automation and a Rockwell technology partner. READY Robotics’ ForgeOS platform is designed to enable operators to control and program popular brands of robots from a single user-friendly interface with minimal training, explains Rockwell in a press statement. Rockwell Automation and READY Robotics have collaborated to integrate ForgeOS with Rockwell’s line of Logix controllers and design and simulation software. The company explains that the combination will simplify robot integration and accelerate the time-to-market of industrial automation deployments. Rockwell’s investment will foster the continued development of the ForgeOS platform, support its integration with Logix and accelerate adoption across the Rockwell ecosystem of system integrators, and technology and channel partners. “We are excited to work with READY Robotics to help further simplify the use of diverse robotic systems in automation solutions for our customers. Linking the intuitive ForgeOS software suite with Logix control, design, and emulation capabilities allows a broader range of businesses to implement these powerful tools and spend less time getting their systems up and running,” said Matheus Bulho, vice-president and general manager of production automation at Rockwell. “Historically, automation has been hampered by software silos between robot vendors,” said Ben Gibbs, CEO and co-founder of READY Robotics. “READY’s interface alleviates this issue, eases deployment, and enables automation where it might have been prohibitive before, especially in high-mix operations. Our platform enables programming and control of over 3 million compatible robots deployed today.”
