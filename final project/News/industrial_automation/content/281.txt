Quebec, Canada governments fund production line automation at De La Fontaine The governments of Canada and Quebec are granting $4 million to window and door manufacturer De La Fontaine for automation and robotization. De La Fontaine will use the funds to acquire automated and digital equipment to automate its full production line. The automation will focus on the folding and shaping steps and various cutting and gluing phases. To install the new equipment on the main floor, a second floor will be added to the current building for administrative offices.
