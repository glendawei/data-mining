Allied Electronics and Automation now officially known as RS Allied Electronics & Automation officially transitioned its name to “RS,” effective February 6. This name change is part of the company’s ongoing brand evolution. Allied Electronics & Automation is a trading brand of RS Group, a global, omni-channel provider of industrial product and service solutions. The company supports customers in designing, building and maintaining industrial equipment and operations. On May 3, 2022, the Electrocomponents Group changed its trade name listing to RS Group. This was the company’s first step in its brand transition into RS for all companies within the group. Since May, several brands within the group have taken new names — IESA and Synovos became RS Integrated Supply and Needlers and Liscombe became RS Safety Solutions. The group has planned an in-person employee launch event on February 14 at its Fort Worth headquarters to mark this significant milestone. The group announced the rebranding plan for Allied Electronics & Automation in October 2022.
