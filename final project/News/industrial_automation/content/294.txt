Helukabel Group to open automation cable solutions facility in Germany The Helukabel Group, a global cable system solutions provider, is going to build a new facility in Haan, Germany that will house its robotic dress pack and drag chain system subsidiaries under one roof. The new building will also serve as the headquarters of Helukabel’s Rhine-Ruhr sales branch. It is expected to be completed by 2025. “On the one hand, we are expanding our capacity with the new building so that we can continue to grow,” explains Andreas Hoppe, chief financial officer at Helukabel. The goal is to increase the current number of employees on site from 70 to 150 by 2030. “On the other hand, we are in an even better position to integrate our joint capabilities in order to offer our customers ready-to-use and completely customized electrical connection technology solutions.” Robotec Systems’ core business is robotic dress pack solutions. It is a Helukabel subsidiary since 2012 operating out of northwest Germany. EKD Systems, which joined the Helukabel Group at the beginning of 2022, specializes in the development and production of cable drag chains made of steel, stainless steel and plastic. Due to the similarities in both customers and business areas, the corporate group is hoping for considerable synergistic effects from the move to the new location in order to support its global sales network. The new facility will further be supported by the cable-harnessing capabilities of the Helukabel Group’s Sangel Systemtechnik subsidiary to allow customers to have access to either electrical connection components individually or through pre-populated, play-and-play assemblies such as pre-terminated cable assemblies, robotic dress packs, or drag chain systems.
