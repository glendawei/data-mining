ABB opens facility in Mexico to increase project delivery across North America ABB recently opened a new regional operations centre for North America. The company initially invested $1 million in its new Mexico Technology and Engineering Center (MXTEC) in Merida, Yucatan to help reach higher project delivery capacity and increase competitiveness. The facility is expected to bring technology expertise closer to ABB’s customers. The centre, located alongside a community of technology and cybersecurity companies, will be a go-to resource for ABB engineers and covers disciplines including automation, electrical and software engineering. It will mean an approximate 25 percent uptick in its engineering capacity, with some projects involving the commissioning of ABB Ability System 800xA distributed control system (DCS) at customer sites. ABB may add further competencies for supply chain, project management and sales support in the future. ABB’s move comes at a time when industrial companies are addressing their supply chains and either nearshoring or near-sourcing to ensure security and reliability of operations. For ABB, its Mexico facility is well-placed for growth and will link ongoing operations in both North America and South America.
