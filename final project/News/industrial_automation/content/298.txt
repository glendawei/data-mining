Sycodal named Flexiv Robotics’ first Canadian distribution partner Flexiv Robotics, a manufacturer of general-purpose robotics solutions, entered into a distribution partnership with Quebec-based automation integrator Sycodal in the last quarter of 2022. This partnership allows Sycodal to offer Flexiv’s adaptive robotic technology in the Canadian market. The move is part of Flexiv’s continued expansion into North America. Created to address the shortcomings of collaborative robots, adaptive robots offer their users artificial intelligence, force control and computer vision integration to achieve precision. “We are very excited to partner with an established and experienced system integrator in the Canadian market,” said Daire Kullar, Flexiv’s regional sales and business development manager, in a press statement. “Sycodal has opened a door for Flexiv in this market, and we are committed to supporting their growth. We are confident of the abilities Sycodal has to offer and are very impressed with the team’s capabilities.” Flexiv granted Sycodal sole integrator rights for the entirety of Quebec as part of the distribution agreement. “By choosing Sycodal as a distribution partner in Canada and an official integrator in Quebec, Flexiv has not only propelled us to high-potential markets in North America but also offers collaborative solutions at the cutting edge of technology,” said Claude Beauliue, president of Sycodal. “Flexiv leads the path to a strong future now, and our entire team is ready and motivated to bring this technology to the Canadian market.”
