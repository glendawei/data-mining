CME selects finalists of its second annual Ontario Made Awards Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME) has selected the finalists for its second annual Ontario Made Awards on behalf of its Ontario Made program. Finalists for these awards are Ontario manufacturers and retailers that help consumers make informed decisions in increasing the sale and awareness of Ontario-made products. From December 6, 2022, until January 8, 2023, consumers made their voices heard by voting for their favourite manufacturer and retailer in each category. Over 17,000 votes were cast to determine the 12 finalists across four award categories. These finalists are now moving on to the last judging stage of the awards where a panel of industry experts will select the winners in each category. “Despite disruptions in supply chains, border blockades, galloping inflation, and critical labour and skills gaps, 2022 once again highlighted the resilience of Ontario’s manufacturing sector and its ability to produce the goods Canadians need. We are so proud to celebrate Ontario’s hardworking manufacturers and retailers through the Ontario Made program. Once again, Ontarians enthusiastically voted for local manufacturers and retailers in their region through the Ontario Made Awards. It has never been more imperative to celebrate Ontario’s best. We look forward to crowning the winners on February 22 and hope to see different communities from across the province join us virtually to celebrate,” said Dennis Darby, president and CEO of CME. CME will announce the names of the award winners at Ontario Made’s Virtual Awards Ceremony on Wednesday, February 22, 2023 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm EST. Ontarians can show their support for companies in their region by registering here for the free-to-attend event.
