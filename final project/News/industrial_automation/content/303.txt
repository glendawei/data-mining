Pilz releases services package for machinery safety evaluation Pilz’s new “Machinery Safety Evaluation” (MSE) is a new service to evaluate the machinery safety of existing machines. Operators obtain an overview of the safety and conformity status of their machines through a dashboard.
With this new service, Pilz is offering an efficient addition to its risk assessments and plant assessments offerings. The “Machinery Safety Evaluation” service comprises the on-site evaluation of machinery in a production plant with regard to the applicable safety and conformity requirements. In the process, Pilz takes into account the standards and directives applicable at the machine’s place of use or destination. In addition, on request, it can also consider the customers’ individual, in-house specifications. Operators can view the current conformity status of each plant or machine at a glance, on a software-based dashboard. A list of measures with the appropriate recommended actions is available, sorted by priority. On request, Pilz can provide support when implementing these measures. The “Machinery Safety Evaluation” is aimed at operators who wish to have the safety and conformity of their existing machinery evaluated. The Machinery Safety Evaluation by Pilz’s experts is also appropriate for machines that are to be checked for potential retrofit measures or bought-in machinery. Pilz offers two levels of detail for its “Machinery Safety Evaluation”, depending on the customer’s individual requirement. While level 1 checks the conformity of the safety status and lists recommended actions to reduce risk, level 2 also includes an evaluation of the main risks and reviews the documentation. If required, Pilz experts produce a conformity overview in accordance with specific company specifications, evaluate the maximum achievable performance level PLr for the tested subfunctions and, as an option, also provide a cost estimate for a potential upgrade.
