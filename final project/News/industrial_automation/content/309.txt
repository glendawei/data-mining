Schneider Electric, BitSight partner to improve OT cybersecurity exposure Schneider Electric and BitSight entered into a strategic partnership to develop a global Operational Technology (OT) Risk Identification and Threat Intelligence capability. Schneider Electric and BitSight each see their partnership as an important step in furthering their commitment to improve the security and resilience of their communities. The companies are working on a solution that detects OT protocols exposed over the internet and contextualizes them with improved attribution. Through a joint effort, Schneider Electric will fuse its knowledge of OT protocols and systems with BitSight’s exposure detection and management capabilities to generate the critical insights necessary for proactive security monitoring of externally observable risks to the OT community. The goal of this collaboration is to strengthen industrial security and provide more visibility into industrial infrastructure and industrial control system (ICS) devices that may be at risk from a cyber breach. The capabilities derived through this partnership will ​provide the data necessary to identify important areas of risk concentration and help drive further remediation initiatives.   ​ The​​ ​new capability focused on risk identification and reduction across the entirety of the OT domain ​is not an exclusive arrangement between BitSight and Schneider Electric. Participation is open to all OT vendors willing to share information about their products to improve risk detection and attribution capabilities.
