Eaton’s new innovation centre to focus on digital technologies for distributed energy resources Eaton has opened its newest global Innovation Center near Montreal in Brossard, Quebec, following nearly four decades of developing software in the region. At the 35,000-square-foot space, Eaton will accelerate the research and development of distributed energy resource (DER) technologies enabling sustainable electricity for industry, buildings, homes and the electric grid. The latest Eaton Innovation Center focuses on developing advanced solutions to optimize DERs by bringing together multiple disciplines, including cybersecurity, software, human-centred design and automation experts. Eaton will continue its longtime relationships with ÉTS Montréal, Polytechnique Montréal, Université de Sherbrooke, McGill, Université Concordia, Université de Montréal and others to increase the industry workforce. Many of Eaton’s employees in the area are alumni of these institutions. Eaton has a network of manufacturing locations in Canada that build medium- and low-voltage power distribution equipment for industrial, commercial and residential applications.  The company is reportedly focused on developing innovative solutions that enable customers to conserve resources, decrease emissions and energy consumption, and make smart energy decisions – all while increasing safety, reliability and resilience.
