Endress+Hauser Customer Experience Centre wins Rethinking Future Award The new Endress+Hauser Customer Experience Centre was named the winner of the Rethinking The Future Award 2022 in the Industrial (Built) category. Rethinking The Future is an annual award program that aims to promote outstanding work in the field of architecture and design across the world. The 47,000-square-foot Customer Experience Centre established a new sustainability standard for the family-owned, Swiss-based, industrial process measurement and analysis company’s global portfolio of facilities. The centre, officially inaugurated last May, also is the first privately owned project in Canada to pursue both ZCB Certification and LEED Gold simultaneously. It recently attained the ZCB Certification, the standard demonstrating that a building has achieved zero-carbon operations. It is anticipated the site will produce more energy than the facility will require on an annual basis through a combination of rooftop double-sided solar panels, heat pumps supplemented by a geothermal system, and innovative energy-conservation practices. The centre is home to workplace and administrative zones, a Process Training Unit (PTU), multipurpose training rooms, workshop/repair area, Factory Acceptance Testing and calibration labs, kitchen and cafeteria areas, fitness room, and warehouse space. The PTU is a full-demonstration platform for the latest Endress+Hauser devices and solutions for process measurement and analysis. It’s one of only one of two PTUs in Canada; the other is at Endress+Hauser Canada’s Edmonton, Alta. facility. The development team, comprised of stakeholders including McCallumSather, the project architect, endeavoured to raise the bar for sustainability throughout the Burlington facility. The outcome is a high-performance building enclosure for creative mechanical system solutions and sustainable materials selection, supported by sustainable construction practices.
