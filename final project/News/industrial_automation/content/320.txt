CME looks back at 2022 and shares what to expect in 2023 In a statement released by the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME), the association says that Canada is continuing to navigate historically high job vacancies, according to a recent Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. This underscores CME’s calls for increased immigration and strong government actions to help manufacturers get the workers they need. CME adds that while job vacancies in manufacturing declined 8.7 percent to 78,500 in the third quarter of 2022, they remain significantly higher than before the pandemic. The numbers were more than double the level of 2017. As a result, close to five percent of all manufacturing positions were open in this year’s third quarter, up from under three percent in the same quarter of 2019. Upping the immigration levels is just one of CME’s asks of the government as it takes stock of 2022 and looks ahead to the new year. “This year has once again highlighted the resilience of the Canadian manufacturing sector,” said Dennis Darby, president and CEO of CME. “Despite disruptions in supply chains, border blockades, galloping inflation, and critical labour and skills gaps, our manufacturing sector is strong and producing the goods Canadians need.” “CME’s focus for 2023 is ensuring manufacturers are set up for success and that means continuing to press the government on increasing immigration, and developing an industrial strategy so that our sector does not fall behind,” said Darby. “We are excited about the year ahead and the potential for manufacturing, which provides stable, well-paying jobs for so many hard-working Canadians.”
