Omron to introduce new automated line inspection systems at IPC Apex Expo 2023 Omron Automation Americas will introduce two new automated optical inspection (AOI) systems at IPC Apex 2023 in San Diego – the VT-Z600 and VT-S1040. The event takes place from January 21 to 26, 2023. The VT-Z600 is Omron’s fastest pre/post reflow AOI system. It features multi-direction and multi-colour (MDMC) illumination to achieve a new level of stable and flexible inspection. The VT-S1040 is also intended for pre/post reflow inspection. It too features MDMC illumination. In addition, it includes AI-assisted, micro phase shift (MPS) 3D reconstruction, which further improves defect detection and first-pass yields while reducing false calls. Both systems incorporate Omron hardware. They are designed to have a long operational life in demanding manufacturing environments and can be field upgradable in the future, according to the company. “IPC Apex Expo is a great venue for answering technical and process questions and showing new systems like the VT-Z600 and VT-S1040,” says Brad Ward, technical manager for advanced sensing and inspection solutions at Omron. “It’s a low pressure environment that allows customers to fulfill a key stage of their crucial technology evaluation.” Omron will also showcase its VT-X750 inline CT X-ray inspection system at the event. The VT-X750 CT AXI is a 3D system and a suitable for critical SMT, THT and press-fit device inspection across all industries. Its imaging technology identifies the widest array of BGA solder joint quality and reliability issues, including voids and difficult-to-image hidden-in-pillow (HiP) defects. The Omron team will also answer questions about the company’s Q-upNavi software suite that allows machine-to-machine (M2M) communications between SPI, AOI and AXI systems.
