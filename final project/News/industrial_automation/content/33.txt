Ontario supports auto parts manufacturers in Durham region The Ontario government is supporting 26 small and medium-sized automotive parts suppliers with an investment of $3.5 million through the Ontario Automotive Modernization Program (O-AMP), an initiative to support local manufacturers and expand Ontario’s end-to-end automotive supply chain. The suppliers are investing almost $9.6 million in new tools and technology to enhance their competitiveness and create 111 new, good-paying jobs. “As we continue to grow our automotive and manufacturing sectors, we want Ontario’s auto parts manufacturers to remain competitive both domestically and internationally,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “When we invest in these companies, the economic benefits reach well beyond local communities, creating highly skilled and good-paying jobs right across the province.” Tool Die-Namics, a Pickering-based tool and die manufacturer, is among the 26 companies to receive support. With $150,000 in O-AMP funding, the company will invest over $329,000 in state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment to increase the efficiency and productivity of their current operations, and to meet growing demand. “Tool Die-Namics is committed to provide our industry with the best quality tooling possible to engineer and build,” said Robert Cake, president of Tool Die-Namics. “O-AMP gives us the feeling we, in Ontario, are a team and we are determined to succeed. Today we compete in a global marketplace and having the support of our provincial government provides the incentive to pursue business abroad.” Launched in 2019, O-AMP is a $22 million program to help small and medium-sized automotive parts suppliers adopt the tools, technologies and manufacturing practices needed to scale up, modernize operations and increase competitiveness. Companies can apply to receive up to 50 percent of eligible project costs of up to $150,000.
