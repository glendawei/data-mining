Canadian Manufacturing Coalition members to discuss industry growth with ministers Members of the Canadian Manufacturing Coalition (CMC), a group representing Canada’s manufacturing trade associations, chaired by Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME), are meeting Ministers and MPPs on December 7 at Queen’s Park to discuss how government and industry can work together to drive investment in manufacturing and grow the sector. Manufacturing representatives will meet George Pirie, Minister of Mines, Grayson Smith, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, and Charmaine Williams, Associate Minister of Women’s Social and Economic Opportunity, as well as MPPs, political staff and officials. “We look forward to meeting with MPPs across party lines and government officials to stress the importance of manufacturing, address the challenging investments for the sector, especially with the recent passing of the Inflation Reduction by the U.S., and to inform Ontario’s Advanced Manufacturing Strategy,” said Dennis Darby, chair of CMC and president and CEO of CME, in a press statement. CME states that to lay a foundation for an advanced manufacturing strategy, Ontario should act on three urgent priorities: “An Ontario manufacturing strategy built around these three pillars will sustain investment and preserve the competitive position of manufacturers from across the province,” added Darby.
