Omron names PPD Automation as latest Certified Systems Integrator partner Omron Automation Americas recently added PPD Automation as its new partner in its Certified Systems Integrator program. The Quebec-based PPD Automation has experience in control panel building, robotics and Industry 4.0 solutions. According to a statement released by Omron, PPD Automation’s mission is to turn a challenge into an advantage by helping customers increase production speed, reduce costs and maintain high product quality. PPD Automation offers diverse technologies and turnkey automation solutions for manufacturers using the legacy Omron “C” series PLC and the Sysmac platform. The company recently incorporated Omron collaborative robots into a palletizing solution as part of its robotics offering. It is now working with Omron to expand its solutions portfolio further by adding autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). PPD Automation has become a trusted Omron System Integrator through its continued excellence in project results, according to Omron. The certification process is a statement of its ability to deliver consistently excellent results using Omron’s Sysmac platform and collaborative technologies. “Reaching the Certified Level is a significant milestone achieved by a talented team,” says Mario St-Onge, vice president of sales and shareholder at PPD Automation. “Omron’s single software architecture and development environment make integration easy for control, safety, and motion, hence enabling our team to focus on generating value to our customer. Honing our skills in multi-robotic solutions and collaborative palletizing projects has been quite a stimulating journey. We look forward to extending our collaboration with Omron to mobile robots to meet the continuously evolving needs of our customers.” Earlier this year, Omron added Valiant TMS, RAMP, Génik and Revtech as its Certified Systems Integrator partners.
