LoRa Alliance certification program now includes SCHC over LoRaWAN testing The LoRa Alliance announced that LoRaWAN certification is now available for end-devices using static context header compression (SCHC). Certification is based on the LoRa Alliance technical specifications for IPv6 published last May, which enable the deployment of IPv6 over LoRaWAN solutions. TheLoRa Alliance is a global association of companies backing the open LoRaWAN standard for Internet of Things (IoT) low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs). The first applications to leverage SCHC for IPv6 over LoRaWAN are smart metering and IoT applications in the smart grid, just two of many applications requiring the use of IPv6-based standards. “As deployments continue to grow to the tens or hundreds of millions of devices, the importance of using open standards has never been greater,” said Donna Moore, CEO and chairwoman of the LoRa Alliance. “Certifying IPv6 over LoRaWAN for end-devices gives end users the level of certainty needed to deploy and benefit from IP-based solutions. With vendors now able to certify LoRaWAN end-devices using SCHC, customers can confidently commit to massive utilities deployments. This will further drive digital industrialization across a wide variety of new markets and applications, which will in turn enable massive IoT.” The certification of IPv6 over LoRaWAN using SCHC confirms that the end-device meets the functional requirements of the LoRaWAN IPv6 Adaptation Layer Specification TS010-1.0.0. End-devices must already be LoRaWAN Certified as a prerequisite of SCHC over LoRaWAN certification. The full testing suite for SCHC over LoRaWAN has been added to the LoRaWAN Certification Test Tool (LCTT), which is available for download now.
