SYSPRO launches global ecosystem of ISV partners for its ERP customers SYSPRO launched a global program to expand its Independent Software Vendor (ISV) offering. The company has structured the new program to offer manufacturers and distributors choice, flexibility and a competitive edge through a suite of certified and vertically integrated ISV solutions that complement and augment SYSPRO ERP in specific enterprise business processes. “Each business has its unique nuances and may customize its ERP to meet process requirements. A rich ecosystem of complementary ISV solutions provides added value to businesses that use an ERP application by giving them a choice to pick from best-of-breed solutions, rather than undertaking heavy customizations. It is vital to invest in an industry-built ERP system that acts as a platform and allows easy integration of third-party solutions,” said Paulo De Matos, chief product officer at SYSPRO. “A deep vetting process is followed to qualify ISVs before being certified into the program, where they then work closely with our team of product experts to ensure compatibility and fit of the solution.” The following ISV solutions are certified within the SYSPRO program. SYSPRO plans to continue to build out a connected community of ISV partners that will complement its evolving product roadmap and enhance the SYSPRO solution.
