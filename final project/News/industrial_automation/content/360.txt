CC-Link Partner Association adds Lattice Semiconductor to its network The CC-Link Partner Association (CLPA) welcomed Lattice Semiconductor as the latest member of its network of industrial automation vendors, system integrators and end users. The new collaboration will help advance interconnected industrial automation applications, enhancing their efficiency, security and safety and benefitting manufacturing industries worldwide, explained the organization in a press statement. The constantly expanding CLPA membership unites industry players to drive the development and adoption of automation devices, enabling the creation of the Connected Industries of the future. These solutions are backed by the organization’s open network technologies. This provides the requisite foundation for interconnectivity, interoperability and standardization among different automation products. Compatibility with the CLPA’s industrial communications protocols is provided via hardware and software tools for product development, such as field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and intellectual property (IP) cores. Matt Dobrodziej, vice-president of segment marketing and business development at Lattice, said in a press statement, “As Industry 4.0 advancements continue, seamless IT and OT network interoperation, real-time control, and flexible product support are essential for security, safety, and reliability in smart factories. We look forward to collaborating with the CLPA to deliver optimized industrial networking solutions powered by our FPGA solutions and IPs, including the Lattice Automate solution stack and Lattice mVision solution stack.”
