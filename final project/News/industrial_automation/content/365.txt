Rockwell Automation, Cognite collaborate to offer industrial data hub solution Rockwell Automation is partnering with Cognite to create an industrial data hub. The strategic partnership combines Rockwell’s FactoryTalk software with Cognite’s Industrial DataOps platform, Cognite Data Fusion to create the hub. “Manufacturers of all sizes struggle with getting access to, and value from, their data.  A unifying information hub can provide a single source of truth for all manufacturing data without a major investment in proprietary and costly platforms,” says Rockwell’s Brian Shepherd, senior vice-president of software and control. “The bigger a company is, the harder it is to pull data together from all the different sources and then get meaningful analytic insights affordably. Our partnership with Cognite will directly address these challenges.” The partnership between Rockwell and Cognite will bring to market the edge-to-cloud industrial data hub designed to make operational, engineering, enterprise and visual data understandable and comparable for manufacturing across industries. “We are excited to partner with Rockwell Automation to expand their FactoryTalk offerings and further enrich the data central to their applications,” says Girish Rishi, CEO of Cognite. “We look forward to working with Rockwell Automation to accelerate the industrial adoption of applied analytics and digital applications.”
