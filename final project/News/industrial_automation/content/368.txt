Terradyne companies MiR and AutoGuide merge into a single AMR supplier Teradyne companies Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR) and AutoGuide Mobile Robots merge to become a single supplier of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). Effective from the end of September, the integrated company is now officially known as Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR). Long-time Teradyne executive Walter Vahey is president of the newly integrated unit. The new company is headquartered in Odense, Denmark, where MiR has managed its global operations since its 2013 launch. Vahey led Teradyne’s acquisition of MiR in 2018 and AutoGuide a year later. He explains that customers in the global market for internal logistics are asking for a full product line of AMRs spanning low, medium and high payload vehicles to automate material transport throughout the value chain. “By joining forces, we will uniquely meet our customers’ need for automation of internal logistics, from a single supplier offering easy-to-deploy, reliable, scalable AMRs with common fleet management software,” he says. As part of Teradyne, both companies have already been working together to develop a method for their AMRs to operate on the same fleet management software. “This close collaboration accelerated the merger,” notes Vahey. “Being one organization helps ensure we deliver a broad AMR product line operating on a common fleet software to our customers.” MiR develops and markets collaborative mobile robots that can manage internal logistics. Prior to the merger, MiR offered a broad range of AMRs capable of carrying payloads and pallets up to 3000 pounds (1350kg). Combining with AutoGuide, the company’s portfolio will expand to include high-payload AMR tuggers and forklifts that will operate on the MiRFleet software. The new combined company employs 450 employees, including 250 engineers.
