Rockwell Automation completes acquisition of cybersecurity solutions provider Verve Rockwell Automation has completed its acquisition of Verve Industrial Protection, an asset inventory system and vulnerability management solution. Verve will report to the company’s Lifecycle Services operating segment. This acquisition, announced in October, expands Rockwell’s cybersecurity offerings to help build resiliency and security of customers’ operations. “We are excited to welcome Verve’s team to Rockwell Automation,” said Matt Fordenwalt, senior vice-president of Lifecycle Services at Rockwell Automation. “In today’s environment, it’s hard for many organizations to stay ahead of threats and keep their operations safe. The Verve Security Center is a way for us to equip our customers with actionable intelligence to protect their infrastructure.” Rockwell shares that Verve’s platform has helped clients mitigate thousands of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It is complementary to the company’s current offerings, including partner technologies and will integrate information into a single pane of glass to help customers manage and prioritize risk. Verve is being featured at Rockwell’s Automation Fair from November 6 to 9 in Boston.
