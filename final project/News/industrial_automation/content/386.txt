NGen announces $50 million AI for Manufacturing funding challenge Next Generation Manufacturing Canada (NGen) has announced an investment of up to $17.5 million for its AI for Manufacturing funding challenge. The organization is targeting $50 million in combined NGen and industry investments. For this purpose, NGen has issued a call for project proposals to build advanced manufacturing capacity in Canada and enhance the commercialization of artificial and machine learning innovations across manufacturing sectors in Canada. To apply for the funds, projects must focus on the commercialization of AI/ML solutions in manufacturing. They must also be business-led and collaborative. Research organizations, companies and organizations working outside the manufacturing sector that can contribute technical expertise and knowledge to project consortia are also welcome to participate, notes NGen. Projects must include at least two industry partners, one manufacturing company and one AI company. At least one of these companies needs to be a Small Medium Enterprise. More extensive engagement with manufacturers or applications involving multiple manufacturing sites is encouraged. Total project costs should be between $2M and $8M. NGen adds that eligible projects will be reimbursed at a funding rate of 35 percent of total eligible project costs. Funding submissions will be in two rounds. The first submission deadline for the full funding proposal is December 7. The deadline for the second round of projects is February 14, 2023. NGen will conduct workshops and briefing events in the coming months. This is in addition to a project collaboration event scheduled for November 8 for applicants to pitch project ideas to find collaboration partners. The challenge will support AI-enabled advanced manufacturing technology development and commercialization such as: Register here for the collaboration event.
