MachineMetrics, Universal Robots partner to offer robot performance monitoring solution MachineMetrics announced the release of its connector for Universal Robots (UR). The product connects to and captures valuable data from any UR equipment. The connector is available through the UR+ program to all current UR cobot users. According to MachineMetrics, it enables instant insights into the health and performance of UR cobots. “Connecting to – and capturing real-time data from – manufacturing equipment is what enables our customers to quickly and easily understand their production performance and the health of their machines,” said Bill Bither, CEO and co-founder of MachineMetrics, “By connecting UR cobots to MachineMetrics, users can now gain real-time insights into cobot productivity, alert teams when issues arise, and remotely troubleshoot and diagnose issues to get the cobot back up and running.” The announcement of the connector for Universal Robots follows MachineMetrics’ successful June 2021 series B funding round led by Teradyne, the parent company of Universal Robots. “Extending the value of MachineMetrics to drive automation is the next generation of solution for manufacturers,” said Bither. “On its own, MachineMetrics can let the right person or system know at the right time what is happening to keep machines running. In an autonomous factory powered by MachineMetrics, machine data can trigger an action by a robot that feeds the bar into the machine without human intervention.”
