Blaize and Accton collaborate on to bring edge AI solutions to AI inspection market Blaize and Accton announced a strategic partnership with Accton, to bring edge AI computing to the AI inspection market. The Accton Smart Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) solution will use the Blaize Pathfinder P1600 Embedded System on Module (SoM) to add visual AI production line inspection for assembly, manufacturing, packaging and appearance activities. “We are pleased to partner with Blaize to provide our customers with a cost-effective AI inspection service,” said Colby Chou, IoT business unit head of Accton. “With the Blaize solution, we can easily deploy a powerful service to manufacturers of all sizes.” The Accton product Pallas uses Blaize’s P1600 SoM, leveraging the programmability and efficiency benefits of the Blaize Graph Streaming Processor architecture. The SoM is suitable for rugged and challenging environments and offers processing power, low latency and energy efficiency needed for AI inferencing workloads at the edge and the inherent stringent inspection requirements. Accton will be able to implement computer vision applications and new AI inferencing solutions across a range of edge smart vision use cases using the Blaize architecture. “Blaize looks forward to providing Accton with a solution that enables stricter quality standards, higher yield and more efficient manufacturing and inspection processes,” said Dinakar Munagala, co-founder and CEO of Blaize.
