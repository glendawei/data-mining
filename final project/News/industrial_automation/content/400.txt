Realtime Robotics integrates its RapidPlan software with Siemens Process Simulate Realtime Robotics has teamed up with Siemens to integrate its RapidPlan software with Siemens Process Simulate, in the company’s Tecnomatix portfolio. This integration allows Siemens customers to use Realtime’s robot motion planning and control software as a part of their regular workflow, without leaving Process Simulate. Customers using the integration can visualize, prioritize and simulate robot task plans. They can also validate them through virtual commissioning. Support for servo weld guns has also been added. “The combination of Process Simulate with Realtime Robotics’ automated motion planning and interlocking has provided a significant improvement to our efficiency, reducing our off-line programming efforts by more than 80 percent,” said Michael Schaubmayr, group manager of mechanical engineering simulation, at Valiant TMS. “This presents to us a tangible and strategic advantage in the industry.” With Realtime Robotics for Siemens Process Simulate, positions and waypoints can be updated without reprogramming. Time-consuming manual tasks can be reduced with automated and collision-free interlock programming. Additionally, a massive reduction in programming time can be realized, says Realtime Robotics. “Robot programming and task planning has been a time-consuming – and frankly, difficult – process for far too long. We founded Realtime Robotics to change that once and for all,” said George Konidaris, co-founder and chief roboticist at Realtime Robotics. “This integration with Siemens will make it much easier for those using Process Simulate to eliminate collisions and quickly take robot task plans from simulation to reality.”
