ISA announces new training series on digital transformation The International Society of Automation (ISA) has introduced its new Digital Transformation Training Series. It is a set of courses covering emerging technologies associated with digital transformation. “The ISA digital transformation series will help organizations cross the chasm on adoption of digital technologies and upskill workforce across their enterprise,” said Prabhu Soundarrajan, ISA executive board member and president-elect for 2024. ISA explains that the series aims to increase the foundational knowledge of these technologies and explain how they can be applied to drive efficiency across multiple industries. The series is suitable for engineers, technicians, business leaders and managers engaged in industrial automation and its related fields. The Digital Transformation Training Series’ first course, Introduction to IIoT — The Industrial Internet of Things (DT101), is currently available to purchase. This course will provide awareness of the industry 4.0 movement as businesses begin shifting more towards increasing digital transformation efforts for conventional industrial and manufacturing processes. Students will learn about the basic concepts of the internet of things (IoT), how these concepts and underlying technologies have evolved and how they are currently being applied to industrial applications. “This training is different for two reasons. First, it’s modular-based and will keep growing over time. Second, it includes a mix of theory and strategy with hands-on practical applications that are related to real-world controls and automation professionals that they live in every day,” said Jeff Winter, division director of ISA’s smart manufacturing and IIoT division (SM/IIoT) and industry executive of manufacturing at Microsoft. ISA is currently developing additional topics on big data and data visualization and plans to release them in late 2022.
