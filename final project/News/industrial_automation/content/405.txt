Wachendorff adds to its product lineup of Ethernet-based encoders Wachendorff expands its range of Ethernet-based encoders that feature EtherNet/IP protocol. The newest addition includes the compact WDGA58F. Wachendorff’s R&D team succeeded in minimizing the sensor to an installation depth of 46.5 millimetres. The encoders are certified by the ODVA. The resolution in single and multi-turn can be individually configured via an integrated web server (single-turn 16 bit, multi-turn 43 bit). High environmental data, e.g. temperature range from -40 °C up to +85 °C, shock 1,000 m/s² or vibration 50 m/s² at 10-2000 Hz, allow the use of the product in harsh industrial environments as well as in mobile working machines. The devices with hollow end shafts eliminate the need for additional couplings and the devices with shafts allow for a long-lasting and stable connection with their high bearing loads of up to 400 N.
