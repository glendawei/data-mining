ISASecure program announces the new ISASecure certification for IIOT components The ISASecure program announced the new ISASecure certification offering for industrial internet of things (IIoT) components based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards. The IIoT Component Security Assurance (ICSA) certification was inspired by recommendations published in the joint ISA Global Security Alliance (ISAGCA) and ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) study. Details of this landmark study are available in the Learning Center section of the ISASecure website and were presented during ISA’s October 2021 webinar. The study and resulting ISASecure IIOT certification scheme address the urgent need for industry-vetted IIoT certification programs. Founded in 2007, the ISA Security Compliance Institute’s (ISCI) mission is to provide the highest level of assurance possible for the cybersecurity of automation control systems. ISCI has been conducting ISASecure certifications on automation and control systems since 2011 through its network of ISO/IEC 17065 accredited certification bodies.
