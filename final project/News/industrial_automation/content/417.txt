Dematic announces strategic partnership with warehouse robotics expert Dexterity Dematic has entered into a strategic partnership with warehouse robotics expert Dexterity. Dematic will now offer full-task robotics globally as part of its intelligent automation solutions. Dematic will deploy robotic systems already contracted with Dexterity’s consumer goods manufacturing, retail and parcel customers. The company will also sell and deploy Dexterity solutions within its own warehouse, distribution and order fulfillment customers over the next several years. “Our growing partnership with Dexterity is yet another example of Dematic taking the necessary steps to continue to be a software and technology leader,” said Hasan Dandashly, president of Dematic and KION Group executive board member. Dexterity’s SaaS-based robotic intelligence platform turns standard industrial robotic arms into full-task robots with a sense of touch, vision and the ability to learn and multitask. Full-task robots are able to solve difficult operational challenges, including creating mixed-SKU pallets, singulating and inducting items and fulfilling orders. Dexterity’s approach to its robotics platform aligns with Dematic’s systems and software roadmap. This partnership accelerates Dematic’s ability to offer customers autonomous solutions that increase the flexibility of fixed automation solutions. The partnership will help elevate customer confidence in robotics. Now, for supply chain challenges best solved with the operational advantages of robotics, Dematic and Dexterity will work together to deliver and support modular solutions — from initiation and planning to execution and live operations. “Partnering with an industry leader like Dematic will accelerate Dexterity customers deploying robots and greatly expand the global reach of Dexterity robots,” said Dexterity CEO Samir Menon.
