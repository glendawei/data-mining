Stratasys to acquire Covestro’s additive manufacturing materials business Stratasys signed a definitive agreement to acquire the additive manufacturing materials business of Covestro. The acquisition will include research and facilities and activities, global development and sales teams. In addition, it will bring in a portfolio of approximately 60 additive manufacturing materials and an IP portfolio comprised of hundreds of patents and patents pending. “Innovative materials are the fuel of additive manufacturing and translate directly into the ability to create new use cases for 3D printing, particularly in the production of end-use parts like dental aligners and automotive components,” said Stratasys CEO Dr. Yoav Zeif. “The acquisition of Covestro’s highly regarded additive manufacturing business positions us to further grow adoption of our newest technologies. We will now have the ability to accelerate cutting-edge developments in 3D printing materials, and advance our strategy of providing the best and most complete polymer 3D printing portfolio in the industry.” Covestro has been a key part of Stratasys’ third-party materials ecosystem. The acquisition will be beneficial to customers using multiple Stratasys 3D printing platforms, including its Origin P3, Neo stereolithography and H350 printers. Stratasys is already a distributor of Covestro’s Somos resins and they are already available for Neo and Origin One 3D printers. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2023.
