The Power Transmission Distributors Association welcomes a new member The Power Transmission Distributors Association (PTDA), an association for the industrial power transmission/motion control (PT/MC) distribution channel, recently welcomed a new member company – MEM Industrial. MEM Industrial was established in 2003 as a rebuild shop for electric motors, gearboxes and pumps. In 2015, the company opened a segment dedicated to parts – Midwest Industrial Supplies. Following the 2019 merger of the two ventures, MEM Industrial was formed. MEM is a distributor of variable speed drives, bearings, belts and chains, conveyors and material handling components, shaft couplings and u-joints, gearings, motors, industrial specialty chemicals, linear motion components, pumps and accessories. “We felt that joining PTDA was a must to let people know we’re part of the best out there, and it never hurts to network,” says Scott Arnold, general manager.
