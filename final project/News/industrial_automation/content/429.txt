SICK, Aeva collaboration to add 4D LiDAR to industrial sensing applications Aeva and SICK AG announced a strategic multi-year partnership to bring 4D LiDAR to industrial sensing. Aeva will bring its FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) 4D LiDAR to a variety of industrial sensing applications. These include long-range sensing, starting with Aeries II. “We are pleased to partner with Aeva and work closely together to bring its FMCW technology to high-performance industrial sensing applications,” said Dr. Niels Syassen, member of the executive board responsible for technology and digitization at SICK. “We are convinced that their unique approach to FMCW technology, which includes instant velocity detection and long-range performance, will provide new opportunities for us and our customers in a variety of industrial sensing applications where the traditional time of flight LiDAR technologies are challenged.” Aeva’s FMCW 4D LiDAR technology offers perception advantages over sensing technologies like cameras and legacy 3D LiDAR sensors. The technology allows for dynamic range performance to perceive low and high reflectivity targets within the same measurement without edge effects, allowing automated machinery to transition easily from indoor to outdoor operation. Aeva’s technology is immune to blooming and ghosting from retroreflectors. Automated machines using Aeva’s 4D LiDAR will have a clear perception when highly reflective objects are in the sensor’s field of view. “SICK is one of the foremost leaders in industrial sensing solutions and today’s partnership is a major step forward for the advancement of high performance and reliable FMCW-based sensing across a broad set of industrial applications,” said Soroush Salehian, co-founder and CEO at Aeva.
