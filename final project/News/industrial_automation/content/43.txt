Ontario manufacturer receives provincial support to build advanced manufacturing facility TNR Industrial Doors, a manufacturer of high-performance rubber, freezer and cooler doors, is investing $40 million to build a new advanced manufacturing facility. With this investment, the company – a subsidiary of German-owned Hörmann Group — will build a new 120,000-square-foot facility with advanced automation technology to increase production and reduce costs. The facility will create 30 new jobs in Oro-Medonte. “This new facility of the family-run Hörmann Group signifies more than just bricks and mortar,” said Marcus von Reden, president of TNR Industrial Doors. “It symbolizes the spirit of progress, the promise of employment, and the hope of a brighter future for this community. The manufacturing facility we are breaking ground on today will create jobs, drive economic growth, and put Oro-Medonte on the map as a hub for cutting-edge technological advancements in the world of door manufacturing.” To support this investment, Ontario is providing TNR Industrial Doors with $5 million through the Regional Development Program’s Southwestern Ontario Development Fund. “Ontario’s robust manufacturing sector continues to grow thanks to companies like TNR Industrial Doors,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “Through our Regional Development Program, our government is creating the right conditions for manufacturers to expand and create new jobs for workers in communities across the province. Thank you, TNR Industrial Doors, for strengthening your presence in Ontario.”
