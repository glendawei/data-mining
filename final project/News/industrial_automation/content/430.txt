IIC updates its Industrial Internet Networking Framework guide The Industry IoT Consortium (IIC) recently updated and published its Industrial Internet Networking Framework (IINF). The IINF is a guide to help IIoT application developers design, deploy and operate successful networking solutions. The framework guides technologies at the Internet Protocol (IP) and lower layers and related capabilities such as management and security. It underpins digital transformation across industries. “The main advantage of satellites over terrestrial networks is their wide coverage on a regional and continental scale,” said David Lou P.hD., co-chair of the IIC Networking Task Group and chief innovation and strategy officer at Huawei. “Even though closing the link budget for IIoT devices is challenging, satellite technology can support IIoT devices as a direct radio access network. They can also serve as a backhaul technology for wireless or wired networks at any altitude.” The latest update to the publication includes new guidance on deploying satellite communications technologies instead of terrestrial networks, which can be technically and economically unfeasible. Developers can now deploy satellites to connect IIoT devices spread over vast areas or for connectivity in remote, underpopulated land areas, or over the seas and oceans.
