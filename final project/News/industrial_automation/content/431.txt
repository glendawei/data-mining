POSITAL names Andy Zou to key position in Canadian and Latin American operations POSITAL, and its parent company FRABA, has named Andy Zou as the ‘new face’ and the ‘new man’ on the ground in Canada. Zou is now responsible for developing stronger ties with customers and distribution partners in Canada and Latin America. “My aim is to help build awareness of FRABA’s POSITAL and UBITO brands in these important markets,” says Zou. “We have an exciting range of products for the manufacturing and process industries, and I am eager to help customers find ways of using them in their products and production facilities.” Zou joined POSITAL’s Asian operations in 2013 and emigrated from Shanghai to Canada in late 2019. A resident of Markham, Ont., he is a member of the FRABA group’s Sales Council and works closely with the company’s North American headquarters in Hamilton, New Jersey. Zou started his professional career with ZPMC, a leading manufacturer of cranes and materials handling equipment for ports. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai’s Donghua University and an MBA from Tongji University. “We experienced considerable success in growing the market for POSITAL products in China and other Asian countries. The Covid pandemic has made it more difficult to meet people in Canada face-to-face, but with restrictions lifting and trade shows coming back to life, I’m excited about establishing closer contacts with our distribution partners and key customers. I also look forward to exploring more of Canada’s great outdoors,” adds Zou.
