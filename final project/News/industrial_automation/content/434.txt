POSITAL updates its online product finder tool; adds kit encoders POSITAL, a manufacturer specializing in encoders, has updated its online Product Finder tool. The search tool now includes POSITAL’s comprehensive line of kit encoders. The online Product Finder tool (available at www.posital.com) allows the company’s customers to explore its products available conveniently. With this tool, when users select the features they need, the system zeroes in on the models that will be the best fit for the intended application. The Product Finder tool also provides datasheets, manuals and technical drawings. POSITAL offers over 200 kit encoder variants. The products feature multiple mechanical configurations and communications options. Standard kit encoders have an outer diameter of 36 mm, while compact versions – only 22 mm across – are ideal for space-critical installations. Both sizes are available with a range of mounting and shaft coupling options. SSI and BiSS C communications interfaces are supported. Single-turn and multiturn variants are available, the latter featuring POSITAL’s battery-less, self-powered Wiegand rotation counter system. A special range of hollow-shaft encoders are also available. These ring-shaped devices feature 30- or 50-mm center openings and are designed to be installed around large-diameter shafts, structural members or wire/hose bundles in robot arms. Kit (or modular) encoders are designed to be integrated into electric motors or other types of rotating machinery, providing position feedback for the control system.
