Mitsubishi Electric Automation introduces bundled servo and motion solutions Mitsubishi Electric Automation is now offering Economy Solutions. These are packaged servo and motion bundles that allow quick and affordable integration of high precision motion control. The company is currently offering three different bundles – compact motion, basic motion and pulse motion. Compact motion is available in up to 7.0 kW. It offers up to eight axes of synchronized motion per module and operates on the new CC-Link IE Time-Sensitive Network (TSN) allowing for improved communications speed. Basic motion is the most affordable option and uses the integrated networking of the iQ-F compact PLC to control servo amplifiers and motors at a low cost. It operates over the CC-Link IE Field Basic network and allows the integration of other IE Field Basic compatible devices. It is ideal for small systems and supports up to 16 stations. The pulse motion bundle is for easy integration with third party PLCs. It operates over pulse train communication. It is able to communicate with almost any PLC. Also suited for smaller systems, it does not require a motion module. “This is our first step towards building our portfolio of solutions to improve the customer experience,” said Curtis Sylliaasen, associate product manager at Mitsubishi Electric Automation. ‘”By offering pre-configured options, we will be able to target specific customer pain points with solutions that can be customized to each individual project.”
