Bosch Rexroth to acquire HydraForce, adding to its compact hydraulics portfolio Bosch Rexroth, a Bosch subsidiary, signed an agreement on July 15 to acquire Hydraforce. This acquisition adds HydraForce to Bosch Rexroth’s compact hydraulics product portfolio. “With its diversified portfolio and international setup, Bosch Rexroth has a strong foundation. The acquisition of HydraForce expands our global market access through indirect sales channels. Sales partners and system integrators will become important target groups. In these challenging times, we are also helping to stabilize regional supply chains so that we can support our customers even better,” says Frank Hess, vice-president, Compact Hydraulics Business Unit of Bosch Rexroth.

I believe the new ownership will create great opportunities for our customers, partners and employees and lead to sustained growth,” says Mike Terzich, president and CEO of HydraForce. The regional sales structures of HydraForce and Bosch Rexroth complement each other as well.  The addition of HydraForce will significantly improve Bosch Rexroth’s global market access through indirect sales channels. This aligns with Bosch Rexroth’s long-term strategic target.
