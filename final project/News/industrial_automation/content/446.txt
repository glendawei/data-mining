FORT Robotics receives $25 million to further expand its machine communications platform FORT Robotics (FORT) received $25 million in Series B funding, led by Tiger Global. The company will use the funds to accelerate the rollout of its machine communications platform. FORT’s platform is designed to make autonomous machines safer and more secure. “Smart machines are transforming the world, but they come with unprecedented safety and security risks,” said Samuel Reeves, founder and CEO of FORT. “There’s a massive need for these machines to communicate in a trustworthy way, and it’s something that’s yet to be addressed in the industry. This investment will allow us to scale up to meet the demands of the next generation of smart machines.” FORT seeks to address the vulnerabilities of autonomous and connected machinery systems with its platform for machine communications. The FORT Platform fuses functional safety and cybersecurity principles to enable communication to, from and between machines over any network. “Working with FORT enables us to have a dedicated system for safety-critical control, which is really important for a large machine like ours. FORT also helped speed up our development and reduced overall risk for our team,” said Steve Ilmrud, vice-president of Hexagon Metrology, a FORT customer since 2019. FORT’s platform technology is the foundation for its hardware solutions, including wireless emergency stops and remote control systems, that are used by industry leaders including Agility Robotics, Hexagon, Moog, and hundreds of others. With the new investment, FORT plans to expand its platform functionality and enhance security offerings to address the growing demand from end users. The company also announced that Sineesh Keshav, managing director and chief technology officer of Prologis will join FORT’s board.
