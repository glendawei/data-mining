Advanced Motion & Controls now offering new Euchner solutions in Canada Advanced Motion & Controls is offering Euchner’s latest releases in safety engineering components in Canada. The products include an upgraded multifunctional gate box, as well as two innovative FlexFunction solutions – a safety switch and a safe key system. All three products were recently showcased at the Automatica 2022 trade show. Eucher’s upgraded MGB2 Modular multifunctional gate box is now available for the safe EtherCAT P with FSoE. Users get a quick, detailed overview of a device’s status through the comprehensive diagnostic functions in EtherCAT messages and the integrated web server; even replacing the module for servicing takes only a few minutes. Advanced Motion & Controls also carries the CKS2 safe key system, which opens many potential applications and guarantees compliance with the strictest safety standards through highly coded, transponder-based keys. The user decides whether to use the device as a simple way to start and stop machines and processes, as an electronic trapped key system, or as an authorization system for multiple operators by choosing the right RFID key during setup. The device is configured the first time the key is taught-in, and users can reconfigure it for another function anytime. Other relevant applications: fully automated logistics systems and complete turnkey installations. The CTS safety switch is suitable for tasks that require a high locking force in a confined space. Only 135 by 31 by 31 millimetres in size, this compact unit delivers locking force as high as 3,900 newtons for universal use and can be mounted in three orientations, allowing flexible use for hinged or sliding doors. The user can add an escape release at any time.
