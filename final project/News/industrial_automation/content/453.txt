Novarc Technologies presents its collaborative welding robot in Australia Vancouver-based Novarc Technologies recently introduced its Spool Welding Robot (SWR) at the Australian Manufacturing Week in Sydney from June 7 to 10. The SWR increases productivity and shop capacity, delivering required weld quality and improving welder ergonomics. “We’re very excited to have a presence at Australian Manufacturing Week for the first time. Novarc’s welding automation technology provides a solution for manufacturers to transition from manual welding to a welding cobot that lowers the cost of welding, increases productivity and achieves more consistent weld quality,” said Soroush Karimzadeh, CEO of Novarc Technologies. Novarc’s SWR is a welding cobot providing pipe fabrication shops with a collaborative welding robot solution that impacts the way clients can bid on jobs. “Our customers are achieving significant productivity improvements with their Spool Welding Robots, which is allowing them to be much more competitive when bidding on jobs, and increasing the margin on jobs they’ve already won,” added Karimzadeh.
