Mitsubishi Electric Automation launches new online search tool Mitsubishi Electric Automation has launched a new online customer shopping style platform for product selection and search. The platform offers a B2B-type experience. Customers can use it to request pricing quotes for specific products. The platform allows customers to select products based on specifications, or to select products by model number. The system also offers quick recommendations for compatible associated products and accessories. “The guiding principle behind our new platform was to provide our customers an easy-to-use, customer-centric product selection tool in a familiar online purchasing style environment,” said Sloan Zupan, senior director of marketing at Mitsubishi Electric Automation. Customers can find a hyperlink to the platform on the Mitsubishi Electric Automation website. Once on it, they can navigate, search and find products. They can then submit a request for a quote through the platform for quick response by qualified sales engineers. According to Zupan, the platform showed strong results in the proof-of-concept phase and has attracted more than 25,000 unique visitors since late 2021. In addition, more than 75 percent of visitors have come to the platform through organic searches. “Those figures speak to the high quality of the content, which is updated regularly to provide our customers the searchability they want together with the selection they need,” he added. The Mitsubishi Electric platform is available here.
