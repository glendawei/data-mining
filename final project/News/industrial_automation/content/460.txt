Hexagon and ESAB partner to streamline robotic welding processes Hexagon’s Manufacturing Intelligence division is partnering with ESAB to create a streamlined robotic welding solution. The companies are combining Hexagon’s simulation software with ESAB’s InduSuite solutions to achieve this. “ESAB’s partnership with Hexagon will increase manufacturers’ confidence in their welding expertise,” said Jonas Glimden, vice-president of digital solutions and robotics at ESAB. “Manufacturers have had the machinery to perform welds as efficiently as possible, and now we can offer our customers a higher level of built-in knowledge with our joint software solutions to help them make better decisions across their fabrication workflow.” Hexagon explains in a statement that the need to increase process efficiency for the production of welded products in industries such as automotive, aerospace and capital-intensive machinery has increased automation in recent years. Manufacturers now stand to benefit from additional gains by automating elements of design for manufacturing and ensuring consistent welding processes with simulation. ESAB’s InduSuite allows fabricators to digitize welding processes for its machines and centralize weld specifications. This will now include Hexagon’s Simufact Welding software, allowing users to optimize weld sequences and locations by predicting issues such as component distortion based upon induced stresses for operators at the machine. Hexagon will use key parameters from ESAB’s automated robotic fabrication machines to build and refine a digital twin so that fabricators can gain a deeper understanding of their process. “Embedding a digital twin within ESAB’s solutions makes the entire fabrication process smarter by ensuring that key decisions can be made on the shop floor with less dependence on scarce experience and more confidence in data,” said Jessica Zheng, head of virtual manufacturing and costing at Hexagon.
