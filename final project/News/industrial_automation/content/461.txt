Fortinet’s global survey reveals critical challenges in OT security Fortinet recently released its global 2022 State of Operational Technology and Cybersecurity Report. According to Fortinet, the report uncovered widespread gaps in industrial security and indicated opportunities for improvements. The company noted that industrial control environments continue to be a target for cyber criminals, with 93 percent of Operational Technology (OT) organizations experiencing an intrusion in the past 12 months. Here are some of the findings in the report: John Maddison, executive vice-president of products and CMO at Fortinet said, “This year’s global State of OT and Cybersecurity Report demonstrates that while OT security has the attention of organizational leaders, critical security gaps remain. PLCs designed without security, continued intrusions, a lack of centralized visibility across OT activities, and growing connectivity to OT are some of the critical challenges these organizations need to address. Security converged into the OT networking infrastructure, including switches and access points and firewalls, is essential to segment the environment. This combined with a platform that spans OT, converged OT/IT and IT provides end-to-end visibility and control.”
