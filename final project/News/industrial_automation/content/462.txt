Universal Robots launches 20-kg industrial cobot at Automatica Universal Robots (UR) launched a new 20-kilogram cobot called the UR20, at the Automatica trade fair in Munich, Germany. The UR20, the latest addition to the company’s portfolio of cobots, features a new design based on Universal Robots’ experience in engineering. According to the company, UR20’s new joint design will allow for fast cycle times as well as the ability to handle heavier loads. Its 1750 millimetres reach has been designed to work to the full height of the standard Euro-pallet. UR notes that the cobot’s small footprint will allow companies to achieve more within their existing production space. In addition to palletizing, the UR20 can be used for welding, material handling, machine loading and machine tending, as well as for other innovative solutions created by its extensive partner ecosystem. The company launched its first commercially viable cobot in 2008 and has since built an ecosystem of more than 1,100 integrators, distributors and independent partners creating components, kits and applications for its cobots. The company leveraged the knowledge it gained through its established customer base in the design of this latest product. The UR20 is the start of a new series of next-generation cobots which will complement the company’s existing e-Series.
