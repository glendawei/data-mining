Vention launches MachineLogic V4.0, adding to its core MAP products Vention has announced the launch of MachineLogic V4.0, adding to the core products of its manufacturing automation platform (MAP). This is one of its biggest releases since its initial product launch in 2018. The full feature set of MachineLogic is available to users in its cloud version. Subscriptions are needed for those who would like to deploy equipment on the factory floor. Vention is offering MachineLogic on a freemium and subscription basis. MachineLogic V4.0, a cloud and edge software, provides a unified programming interface across robot brands (Universal Robots, Fanuc and Doosan), actuators (linear axis, conveyors, and pneumatics) and I/Os (digital and analog). “MachineLogic is key to our mission of democratizing industrial automation, and subscribers can expect a series of additional features in Q3 and Q4 of 2022,” said Etienne Lacroix, CEO and founder of Vention. “We are only scratching the surface of the user experiences that are possible when you combine industrial automation hardware and engineering software.” The company says that both experts and emerging automation practitioners can program robot cells and automated equipment using simple visual sequences from their web browser, or directly on a teach pendant connected to the equipment. The technology removes the need to learn proprietary programming languages specific to each robot, PLC and motor-drive manufacturer, explains Vention. MachineLogic offers a plug-and-play software and hardware user experience with intuitive component detection and configuration and software-assisted deployment. It works in unison with Vention’s motion controller, MachineMotion and the full library of Vention modular components. MachineLogic V4.0 also has several new features including multi-MachineMotion compatibility, simultaneous robot and actuator programming and JavaScript lambda functions. The subscription offering includes team onboarding training and access to Vention’s customer success team for ongoing support. MachineLogic V4.0 will be available as of July 25, with online training and education webinar starting the same week.
