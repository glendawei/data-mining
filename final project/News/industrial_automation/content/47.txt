Moticont releases two new linear voice coil motors Moticont adds two 12.7 mm (0.500 in.) diameter linear voice coil motors to its product portfolio â€“ the LVCM-013-032-02M (Metric) and the LVCM-013-032-02 (Imperial). The company shares in a press statement that these brushless high-speed linear servo motors have a 25.4 mm 1.000 in. long stroke. They also have a high-force-to-size ratio of 0.70 N (2.5 oz.) and a peak force of 2.20 N (7.9 oz.) at 10 percent duty cycle. Moticont adds that known also as moving coil motors or linear actuators, these products are ideal for dispensing, work holding and clamping, assembly, testing, wafer handling, animation, dynamic vibration absorption, scanners and laser beam steering and filtering. They reportedly feature low inertia and high acceleration/deceleration. These miniature motors are 49.2 mm (1.94 in.) long at mid-stroke. The LVCM-013-032-02M (Metric) Linear Voice Coil Motor has a M3X0.5 threaded mounting hole in the centre of the housing and the coil end. The LVCM-013-032-02 has 4-40 UNC-2B threaded holes for integration of these linear servo motors into a new or existing application. Control electronics are reportedly available for both motors.
