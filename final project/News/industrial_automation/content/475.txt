New Scale Robotics is now ISO 9001:2015 certified New Scale Technologies, including its new Scale Robotics Division, received ISO 9001:2015 certification for its quality management systems. ISO 9001:2015 is the current version of the quality management standards that the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops and publishes. It provides a model for building effective quality management systems based on core quality management principles. “ISO 9001:2015 certification underscores our ongoing commitment to quality in the design and assembly of micro motion modules and fabrication of parts used in all our products, including our automated gauging systems,” said David Henderson, CEO of New Scale Technologies and New Scale Robotics. New Scale Robotics helps quality control and quality assurance teams in high-mix, small-batch manufacturing to automate the contact gauging methods they currently use, both on the production floor and in the quality lab. New Scale’s certificate was issued following an extensive analysis of its quality management systems by an independent auditing firm, Eagle Registrations, accredited by the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB). New Scale will undergo ongoing auditing inspections and annual process verification to maintain its certification.
