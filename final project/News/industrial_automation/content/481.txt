Zebra Technologies closes Matrox Imaging acquisition Zebra Technologies announced that it has completed its acquisition of Matrox Imaging. Located in Quebec, Matrox Imaging develops advanced machine vision components, software and systems. In March, the companies announced that they had entered into a definitive purchase agreement. After entering into the purchase agreement, Matrox president and co-founder Lorne Trottier had noted, “The combination of Matrox Imaging’s technical expertise with the global footprint of Zebra Technologies will present an opportunity for Matrox Imaging to accelerate its long-term strategic plan.” Zebra Technologies specializes in automatic identification and data capture (AIDC). It is an enterprise solutions company that provides technology used to sense, analyze and act in real-time. The acquisition of Matrox Imaging further expands Zebra’s offerings in the fast-growing automation and vision technology solution space. This move comes after the launch of its fixed industrial scanning and machine vision portfolio and recent acquisitions of Adaptive Vision and Fetch Robotics.
