CME forecast shows manufacturing sector faces major challenges to its path to recovery Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters’ (CME) recent forecast data shows that ongoing supply chain disruptions and labour and skill shortages are negatively impacting the recovery of the manufacturing sector. The sector, however, is contributing to Canada’s overall economic recovery. “By most measures, Canada’s recovery from the pandemic has been impressive, but now is not the time to be complacent,” said Dennis Darby, CME President and CEO. “If we do not address the country’s long-term challenges, the economy will soon return to its previous slow growth path.” In a release by the association, Darby notes that it doesn’t have to be this way as Canada has an enormous opportunity to ensure long-term prosperity by winning back manufacturing investment from firms looking to shorten supply chains and reshore production. Here are some highlights from the forecast: “Clearly, there has never been a better time for governments to partner with industry to build a more vibrant and resilient Canadian manufacturing sector,” noted Darby.
