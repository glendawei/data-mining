Vention expands in North America with new Boston office Vention, a cloud-based manufacturing automation platform (MAP), recently expanded its operations in North America with a new office in Boston, United States. This is the second expansion this year by the Montreal-based company, after opening its European headquarters in Berlin, Germany. “Having a local presence in the United States will bring us closer to our American clients and business partners,” said Etienne Lacroix, CEO and co-founder of the company. Vention has been offering its services to manufacturers looking to automate their production floors. Its manufacturing automation platform (MAP) allows manufacturing professionals to design, automate, order and deploy automated equipment and robot cells through an integrated cloud environment. The company’s customers can drive their industrial automation projects by combining 3D design, code-free industrial programming, next-day e-Commerce logistics, and a library of 1,000+ modular automation components. In a release by the company, Vention noted that its North American customers already using its manufacturing automation platform (MAP) will benefit from enhanced coast-to-coast support from a dedicated client team. The expansion will also enable Vention to tap into the pool of Boston’s robotic and engineering software talent to accelerate the development of its platform.
