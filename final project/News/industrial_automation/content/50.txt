Kollmorgen’s Goldline high-voltage servo motors achieve ATEX  and IECEx/cETLus status Kollmorgen recently announced ATEX certification and IECEx/cETLus listing for its explosion-proof Goldline EBH 480 Vac servo motor. These new explosion-proof approvals for the high-voltage Goldline EBH servo motor reiterate Kollmorgen’s commitment to advancing the state of the art in motion control and meeting the most demanding application requirements, says Canadian distributor Electromate in a press statement. The high-voltage Goldline EBH servo motor is now part of a selection of Kollmorgen explosion-proof motors certified and listed according to UL, ATEX, IECEx and/or CSA standards. For high-voltage applications in hazardous locations, Goldline EBH servo motors reportedly offer speeds up to 7,500 rpm with high torque density for maximum performance in a minimal installation footprint. Rugged resolver feedback and a built-in thermostat support reliable operation under harsh environmental conditions. ​​Goldline EBH servo motors in frame sizes 1 – 6 are now part of other explosion-proof motors in the Goldline EB family that meet ATEX/IECEx standards, and more specifically CE 0081 Ex II 2 G Ex d IIB T3 Gb –40ºC ≤ Ta ≤ 40ºC. This classification indicates that the motors are suitable for use in any above-ground industry where easily ignited gases such as ethylene are likely to be present in the atmosphere for 10 to 1,000 hours/year during normal operation (Zones 1 and 2). Kollmorgen reportedly applies a flameproof method of protection to the motor so that any internal ignition is contained within the motor housing without the possibility of escape into the external atmosphere. The maximum surface temperature of the motor under fault conditions is 200​°C. Further details are available on the Electromate website.
