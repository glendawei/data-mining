Universal Robots reports a very successful first quarter in 2022 Universal Robots recently reported that it has achieved record results for the first quarter of the year with a revenue of USD 85 million. This is up 30 percent from the first quarter of 2021. Kim Norgaard Andreasen, chief financial officer of the company, said,”Reporting record Q1 revenue at a time when businesses across the world are facing disruption from the pandemic, supply chain challenges and conflict is a testament to the role collaborative automation can play in helping our customers stay competitive. In addition to record revenue, we have been pleased this quarter to welcome 80 new employees to our rapidly growing company.” In January, Universal Robots reported its 2021 revenue to be over USD 311m. The company attributed this result to the growing awareness of the contribution automation can make to productivity as well as to the role of cobots in supporting businesses facing workforce shortages. “When we consider the trends in both societies and businesses, everything points to a growing demand for automation. We are making plans to meet this demand, including starting work this month on new bigger headquarters in Denmark to help accommodate the company’s growth,” added  Andreasen.
