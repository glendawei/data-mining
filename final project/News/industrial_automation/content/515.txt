Hexagon’s Manufacturing Intelligence division opens new laboratory in Oakville Hexagon’s Manufacturing Intelligence division recently opened a new OEM laboratory at its Precision Center in Oakville, Ontario. The new calibration lab is the main Canadian centre offering support and service for Absolute Arms used for high-end portable measurement and inspection applications. Hexagon technicians will perform testing and calibration procedures according to national and international standards, ensuring customers receive reliable results and consistent data. With the investment in Oakville’s Precision Center, Hexagon has added a large training facility equipped with Absolute Arms for customer use. The facility also features a new shipping and receiving bay. The training area will also support Hexagon’s metrology software portfolio – PC-DMIS, REcreate, and Inspire – for data acquisition and management, analysis, reporting and reverse engineering applications. “We are now able to calibrate, certify, and repair all Absolute Arms, as well as recertify legacy Stinger and ROMER portable arms without shipping equipment outside of Canada. This national hub adds a greater level of convenience for clients that send in their arms for recertification on an annual basis,” said David Hill, director of commercial operations – Canada, Hexagon’s Manufacturing Intelligence division. The Oakville calibration laboratory will serve as an important service hub for the company’s portable arms in Canada. “Hexagon’s investment in our Precision Center puts the finishing touches on our services offerings. Our Precision Center already provides full support for global CMMs and legacy CMMs (Sheffield, Brown & Sharpe, DEA) and offers training classes for our extensive software portfolio. The addition of an accredited laboratory for our popular portable arms was the next logical expansion in Canada,” said Hill.
