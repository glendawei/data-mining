Seneca receives federal support to strengthen artificial intelligence research Seneca College received $641,800 from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to support applied research on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies critical to maintaining a strong Canadian economy. The funds will be used to establish the Innovation in Artificial Intelligence Technologies (CIAIT). At CIAIT, Seneca’s researchers will collaborate with industry partners to find AI solutions in different sectors, including advanced manufacturing, commerce, creative media and finance, among others. “Seneca is grateful for this NSERC funding, which will allow for more applied research that accelerates the adoption of AI-powered solutions for small- and medium-sized Canadian enterprises,” said Ben Rogers, dean of Seneca Innovation. “These projects also offer students with invaluable experiential learning opportunities and connections to potential employers.” Seneca’s data scientists will conduct CIAIT research, focussing on business decision support, content analysis and management and cybersecurity. “This additional support from the Government of Canada is a testament to the value of colleges, CEGEPs and polytechnics and how they contribute to Canadian innovation – from exceptional applied research expertise and training experience to outstanding facilities and equipment, said Alejandro Adem, president of NSERC. “On behalf of the tri-agencies, congratulations to the successful colleges who will benefit from this special investment that will help their students, local businesses and communities thrive.”
