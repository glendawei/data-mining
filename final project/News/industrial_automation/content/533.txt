Advanced Motion & Controls adds Pepperl+Fuchs sensors to its offering Advanced Motion & Controls recently announced the addition of Pepperl+Fuchs sensors to its product lineup. High-quality proximity switches and inductive proximity sensors, as well as capacitive sensors and magnetic field sensors from Pepperl+Fuchs will now be available in Canada. The inductive sensors are applicable for tasks in which accurate, non-contact detection of metallic objects is necessary in automation equipment or other machinery. Pepperl+Fuchs specializes in manufacturing inductive sensors for the global process-control and automation sectors. The standard units feature smooth or threaded stainless steel housing, polarity reversal, short-circuit protection, LED status indication, various connection styles (including M8, M12, and terminal models), and outputs in two-, three-, or four-wire DC, AC, NAMUR, and AS-Interface versions. Models with PVC, PUR, or silicon cable are available. Among the application-specific features of these inductive sensors: The product lineup being offered through Advanced Motion & Controls includes analog output models with 4-20-mA output signals, models with stainless steel sensing faces, exclusive ferrous and non-ferrous detection models and sensors approved for gas and dust Ex zones. Pepperl+Fuchs also manufactures capacitive sensors which operate without physical contact with the target material. Also available through Advanced Motion & Controls, they enable detection of both conductive and non-conductive material but are most popular for sensing plastics, liquid, powder and granular material. The family of magnetic field sensors consists of the M12 housing style for traditional magnetic-detection applications. A non-contact piston-detection sensor is also available for use with steel hydraulic cylinders.
