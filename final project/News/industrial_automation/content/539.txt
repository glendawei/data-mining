Linamar to assume full ownership of GF Linamar joint venture Linamar is acquiring GF Casting Solutions’ (GF) 50 percent interest in their joint venture, GF Linamar, located in Mills River, North Carolina. Linamar will assume 100 percent ownership and operational control of the business. “We are very pleased to complete this transaction with GF,” said Linda Hasenfratz, Linamar’s executive chair and CEO. “GF has been an excellent strategic partner; however, we view this ownership change as key to securing our long-term growth plan in Lightweight Structural Castings. Increasing our Structural content per vehicle is a key strategic priority for Linamar in reducing our business concentration in vehicle powertrains and increasing our content in electrified vehicles where lightweighting is so critical. Acquiring full control over this facility will enable us to be more agile and pursue further market opportunities.” GF Linamar (GFL) is a North American joint venture between Linamar Corporation and GF Casting Solutions, a division of Georg Fischer AG. The two parties originally formed the joint venture in 2015. It combined the expertise of the companies in high-pressure die casting and machining to provide lightweight solutions for automotive and commercial vehicle customers. GFL manufactures structural and powertrain components in aluminum and magnesium. In the interim, GF will continue to support Linamar and the customer’s requirements throughout this transitionary phase. GF Linamar will undergo a rebranding name change and be fully integrated into Linamar’s mobility segment.
