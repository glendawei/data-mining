Deutsche Messe accepting applications for Hermes Award 2022 until April 11 Deutsche Messe announced that it is accepting applications for the 2022 Hermes Award. All companies and institutions participating in Hannover Messe are eligible to submit their entries for the award. The application deadline is April 22. The winner will be announced at the Hannover Messe opening ceremony on 29 May. Bettina Stark-Watzinger, German Minister of Education and Research will present the award. An independent jury, chaired by Professor Reimund Neugebauer, president of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, nominates three products from all the entries for the Hermes Award. The jury then selects the winner from the three finalists. The winner is selected on the basis of technological innovation; benefit to industry, environment and society; cost-effectiveness; and market readiness. The 2021 winner of the Hermes award was Bosch Rexroth, for its SVA R2, an electric actuator that controls process valves underwater. Further details about the award are available here.
