Vention opens European headquarters in Germany Vention, a cloud-based manufacturing automation platform (MAP), officially opened its European headquarters and distribution centre in Berlin, Germany. Headquartered in Montreal, Vention entered the European market in 2020. The latest expansion helps the company reduce its lead times and offer local assistance through a dedicated client team. “Client demand for easy-to-use, accessible, industrial automation technology drove our decision to open our European headquarters in Berlin,” said Etienne Lacroix, founder and CEO of Vention. “It’s a privilege to serve so many European manufacturers through our cloud platform and client team.” Vention stated in a release that its global clients will now benefit from a one-stop shop for all their manufacturing automation needs on both sides of the Atlantic. Vention’s Certified System Integrators is seeing rapid growth in the European region. In addition, it has entered into new marketplace partnerships with automation component manufacturers. The company is planning to invite its clients to visit the Berlin facility in-person to experience its product and application demonstrations.
