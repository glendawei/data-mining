GM and POSCO Chemical to build new facility in Quebec General Motors and POSCO Chemical announced that they are working with the Canadian and Quebec governments to build a new facility in Becancour, Quebec. With an estimated building cost of $500 million, the facility will manufacture cathode active material (CAM) for GM’s Ultium batteries, which will power electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC HUMMER EV and Cadillac LYRIQ. “GM and our supplier partners are creating a new, more secure and more sustainable ecosystem for EVs, built on a foundation of North American resources, technology and manufacturing expertise,” said Doug Parks, GM executive vice-president, slobal product development, purchasing and supply chain. “Canada is playing an important role in our all-electric future, and we are grateful for the strong support we have received from local, provincial and national officials to grow a North American-focused EV value chain.” Construction on the new facility is to begin immediately and is expected to create around 200 jobs. The site will also allow GM to expand in the future to pursue other potential future EV supply chain projects. “With this new processing facility in Bécancour, GM will help lead the EV battery supply chain while also launching Canada’s first full EV manufacturing plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, later this year,”  said Scott Bell, president and managing director of GM Canada. GM’s goal is to have the capacity to build 1 million electric vehicles in North America by the end of 2025. The company has set targets for the majority of components by value to be sustainably sourced, processed or manufactured in North America.
