Increasing automation adoption in manufacturing boosts demand for portable CMMs Increasing automation demand across sectors is inflating the need for portable coordinate measuring machines (CMMs), according to a recent Frost & Sullivan analysis of the global portable CMM industry. Top two industry verticals accelerating the overall market growth of portable are automotive and machine shops. This includes articulated-arm CMM (AACMM) and handheld CMM segments. “Customers’ increased preference for adopting complete or piecemeal Industry 4.0 solutions will augment the need for inline measurement and inspection,” said Ram Ravi, senior industry analyst of industrial practice at Frost & Sullivan. “Further, manufacturers’ need to maximize productivity on the shop floor will drive more automation and robotics, pushing the demand for portable CMMs.” Portable CMMs’ inline measurements capability is expected to boost the market, which is expected to reach $564 million by 2025 from $344.9 million in 2020, an uptick at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3 percent. “With portability and flexibility enabling inline measurements, the AACMM segment will lead the total portable CMMs market growth. On the other hand, the need to better handle temperature changes and deliver accurate measurements in unstable environments will aid the growth of the handheld CMM segment globally,” added Ravi. Frost & Sullivan said in a statement that market participants should do the following to take advantage of the growing portable CMM industry:
