Kinova introduces its first Canadian industrial cobot – Link 6 Montreal-based robotics company Kinova launched Link 6, a  new generation industrial robot designed for businesses looking to leverage the benefits of automation. The Link 6 collaborative robot (cobot) was created entirely in North America. Kinova said in a statement that Link 6 is Canada’s first industrial cobot. Key applications for the cobot include pick-and-place, part assembly and machine tending. “Our operating market is mainly in the United States, where robotics innovation is well established,” explained Charles Deguire, CEO and founder of Kinova. “With the launch of Link 6, we also aim to lend a hand to the Canadian market. Collaborative robots such as Link 6 are an interesting and increasingly sought-after alternative to overcome the labour shortage, here and elsewhere. Kinova is here to help out growing companies, and automation is far more accessible than most people think!” Kinova’s Link 6 controller provides high processing power and memory capacity. It is designed to be used with the AI solutions of the future, while keeping the size of the controller compact. Achieving short cycle times through longer reach and fast movements, the Link 6 robotic arm is developed and designed with any user in mind: an experienced industrial integrator and an operator with no particular robotic skills.
