UR20 debuts in Canada in distributor booths at CMTS 2023 Canadian automation equipment distributors Shelley Automation and Advanced Motion & Controls featured Universal Robots’ UR20 at the Canadian Manufacturing Technology Show (CMTS) from September 25 to 28. Globally launched at Automatica in 2022, the UR20 is Universal Robots’ new 20-kilogram cobot. According to Universal Robots, UR20’s new joint design allows for fast cycle times as well as the ability to handle heavier loads. Its 1750 millimetres reach has been designed to work to the full height of the standard Euro-pallet. UR notes that the cobot’s small footprint will allow companies to achieve more within their existing production space. In addition to palletizing, the UR20 can be used for welding, material handling, machine loading and machine tending, as well as for other innovative solutions created by its extensive partner ecosystem. The CMTS showcase of the UR20 cobot at the two distributor booths marks its debut in the Canadian market. According to Shelley Automation, this launch is important because it is the newest addition to the UR product lineup from the distributor. The company is a gold distributor of UR robots. CMTS attendees had the opportunity to see a demo of the robot. “This launch exemplifies Shelley Automation’s commitment to driving innovation and transformation in Canadian manufacturing. With its capacity to execute a diverse array of tasks, attributed to its extended reach and substantial payload capability, the UR20 not only empowers Canadian manufacturers but also positions them for global competitiveness. Our strategic partnership with Universal Robots signifies a profound commitment to equipping Canadian manufacturers with the tools they need to succeed in a rapidly evolving market,” said Ergun Calisgan, regional manager at Shelley Automation.
