WAGO promotes Tyrone Visser to key leadership position WAGO announced the promotion of Tyrone Visser to the position of WAGO Corporation’s North American business development manager for IIoT and Linux. In his new role, Visser will lead WAGO’s efforts in demonstrating how the company’s PFCs and edge devices can offer more than what is possible traditionally with a PLC. This includes IIoT capabilities and cloud-based transmission as well as using industry-proven open-source software for low-code programming environments, custom visualization, databases and much more. “I really look forward to working with customers to help them leverage these technologies to improve their business results,” said Visser.  “From OEM customers looking to improve services and troubleshooting products in the field to various industrial customers looking to leverage machine data to improve performance and profitability.” Previously, Visser served as a regional sales manager in Canada for the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba territories for six years.
