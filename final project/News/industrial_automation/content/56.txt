PTDA adds five new categories to the PIE Technology Platform The Power Transmission Distributors Association (PTDA) and Bearing Specialists Association (BSA) have introduced seals, linear bearings profile rail, bushings (hub fixing devices), chains and sprockets to the PIE Technology Platform (PIE). PTDA notes in a press statement that PIE is a cloud-based platform giving manufacturers and distributors of industrial products access to a comprehensive catalogue for the exchange of content product information. This tool for channel partners reportedly provides communication of accurate, real-time information strengthens channel partner collaboration and advances e-commerce sales—ensuring end customers have current and reliable product information. PTDA shares that these five additional product categories join the 22 bearing and power transmission already available for the exchange of e-commerce product data between manufacturers and their authorized distributors. Additional categories currently in development include conveyors, material handling, motors and shaft couplings. Categories planned for development include gearing, adjustable/variable speed drives, motor/motion control, clutches and brakes, linear round shaft bushing, ball screws and expanded lubrication. With 24/7/365 access to PIE-compliant manufacturer partner content, distributors can reportedly map rich product data to their company-specific PIM system, website or end-user digital communication using an automated tool. The platform is only accessible to authorized distributor partners, ensuring manufacturers can protect and maintain product data ownership. Both manufacturers and distributors benefit from reduced errors and staff time spent correcting inaccurate or outdated content, states PTDA.
