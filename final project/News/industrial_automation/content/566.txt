RidgeTech Automation adds 3D simulations and virtual commissioning to its service offerings RidgeTech Automation recently added 3D simulations and virtual commissioning to its service offering. The company is now equipped to provide simulations for a wide range of processes and equipment, from individual machines to entire plant solutions. RidgeTech invested in Rockwell Automation’s Emulate 3D Software to merge its control software with clients’ mechanical designs. It is now possible to create fully functioning digital production lines before a single piece of equipment ever gets built. According to the company, this technology is critical in supporting the development of new layouts and processes. It allows clients to test various design concepts without adding the expense of reassembling or relocating physical machines. RidgeTech is also offering virtual commissioning services to help debug designs and logic faster and more efficiently. “Our clients had been asking us to provide these services for a while but with the visitor restrictions and employee limits imposed by the pandemic, we realized it was something we absolutely needed to move forward with. This technology allows us to virtually test and commission systems in a remote environment, letting us catch many of the issues normally found during on-site commissioning. This reduces the length of time and the number of people required in our clients’ facilities,” explained Leigh Spraggett, president of RidgeTech Automation. The additional services allow the company’s clients to: Besides 3D simulation, the company offers 3D cable layouts in conjunction with its 3D panel designs. This service cuts down on time and money spent during installation as it reduces rework and provides installers and electricians with 3D visuals to show how cables should be connected and distributed on machinery and equipment.
