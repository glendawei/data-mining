Endress+Hauser Canada expands smart support coverage with new premium tier Endress+Hauser Canada has added a “Premium” tier to its Smart Support program with additional remote support features and a fast response time when help is requested. The company shares in a press statement that this is aimed at its customers whose businesses might require more vendor support than most because of the size or complexity of their operations. Endress+Hauser explains that Smart Support provides remote technical support for all its instrumentation, including free, unlimited 24/7 access to the company’s knowledge database containing over 16,000 articles on how to self-correct an issue or improve one’s skills. The three Smart Support tiers – Basic, Plus and Premium – are differentiated by the level of active remote support provided and the response time standard for each. The new Premium tier reportedly provides for phone or email support from an Endress+Hauser Canada specialist with an initial response within two hours of the request being filed, seven days a week. This compares to a response within four hours for the Plus tier seven days a week, or 48 hours on weekdays for Basic. Premium customers receive up to six remote device commissioning support instances per year compared with two for Plus. Other benefits for Premium include remote training prescribed by Endress+Hauser plus a 25 percent discount on field service troubleshooting visits. The key features of the support portal at ca.endress.com include the ability for customers to log in to open a support case and monitor its status and history and solve issues by working with an Endress+Hauser Canada support expert via live feed. The Smart Support database contains articles on diagnostics and troubleshooting, and on product and application know-how, such as service operations. Customers may log in, describe the issue and access the database to view a potential solution.
