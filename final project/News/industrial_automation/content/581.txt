Emerson increases cylinder manufacturing capacity to benefit Canadian automation customers Emerson has increased the manufacturing capacity of its Brantford, Ontario, facility to address the immediate-demand automation needs of its Canadian customers better. With this investment, the company has added production of its complete range of Aventics Series PRA Profile Cylinders, Series TRB Tie Rod Cylinders and Series TaskMaster TM5 NFPA Profile cylinders. “The expansion demonstrates Emerson’s investment in and commitment to our Canadian automation customers,” said Stephane Meunier, national sales director at Emerson. “The automation industry in Canada continues to grow, and we want to ensure our customers’ success by getting them components critical to their product designs as quickly as possible.” The increase in local cylinder production capacity will allow Emerson to serve its Canadian automation customers quicker with shorter lead times as well as aftermarket service. The product lead times are expected to be within one to five five business days. The 63,000-square-foot facility is located in Ontario, the province with the largest concentration of automation and robotics-related companies in the country. The Brantford facility expansion aligns with Emerson’s global business strategy of strengthening its supply chain to serve customers better. At the company’s Brantford facility, pneumatic actuators and valves are also manufactured under its Aventics and ASCO brands.
