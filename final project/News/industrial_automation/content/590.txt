Schaeffler Group expands robotics portfolio with Melior Motion acquisition Schaeffler, an automotive and industrial supplier, has announced the acquisition of Melior Motion, strengthening the robotics portfolio of the group’s industrial division. Melior Motion is a supplier of precision gearboxes for robotics and other applications in automation. Due to the rapid increase in automation of manufacturing processes, the group’s industrial division is consistently expanding its position as a supplier for robotics components and systems. The division has brought a Strain-wave gearbox equipped with an electric motor and sensors for use in collaborative robots (cobots) to the point of volume production. It is now adding more powerful gearboxes for higher payload capacities in industrial applications to its portfolio. Over several years, Melior Motion has developed and brought to the market a planetary gearbox for industrial robots that is precise, features repeat accuracy, low noise emissions as well as robustness. A modular platform concept has been developed based on this technology. The first gearboxes of this design have been on the market since 2017. “In Melior Motion GmbH, we are acquiring a highly innovative company in the robotics field that is on a strong growth course. This acquisition adds to our still young portfolio of robot actuators and considerably expands our position as an innovative supplier in this important business area. As a user of robots ourselves, we will also utilize the special characteristics of this portfolio to increase efficiency at our 75 Schaeffler production sites,” says Dr. Stefan Spindler, CEO of Schaeffler’s industrial division.
