The company has established its first office in the U.S., located in the metro Detroit area. “North America is an extremely interesting market for us, and we already have several customers and partners in both Canada and the U.S. However, the interest in our unique GoPal AMR solution is so high that it is a natural next step for us to establish our own presence in North America,” said Anders Pjetursson, the company’s CEO and co-founder.
