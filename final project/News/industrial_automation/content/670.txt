Eviden Announces Joint Asset Performance Management Solution with Samotics for Energy and Utilities Industries Eviden, the Atos business, and Samotics have announced a new strategic partnership. Dec. 5, 2023 - Eviden, the Atos business, leading in digital, cloud, big data and security, and Samotics, a leading provider of real-time actionable insights to eliminate industrial energy waste and unplanned downtime, have announced a new strategic partnership. The collaboration will bring a comprehensive remote asset monitoring solution to global industrial companies and deliver advanced data analytics to drive energy-efficient operations, and reduced energy waste.

Through this partnership, Eviden’s Intelligent Asset Management portfolio will be enhanced with Samotics’ predictive maintenance system SAM4, bringing to market a highly accurate, easily scalable, cost-effective, and quick to implement end-to-end remote monitoring system for industries such as water and wastewater and oil and gas, among others. With its non-intrusive sensors that are installed in the safety of a motor control cabinet, the SAM4 solution is ideally suited for hard-to-reach operational environments where the equipment is either hard-to-access (e.g. borehole pumps in the water) or is operated in harsh conditions (e.g. ATEX zones).

The solution will provide advanced and automated data analytics to detect mechanical degradation, misalignment, electrical faults and other equipment failures in advance, as well as provide real-time performance insights to spot inefficient use of equipment. These concrete and actionable insights will enable companies to eliminate unplanned downtime, optimize performance, increase energy efficiency and reduce waste. With this information, the customers will be able to reduce operational and maintenance costs as well as minimize overall environmental impact.

Rita Marissen, head of Industry Resources & Services, Northern Europe & Asia-Pacific for Eviden, at Atos Group said “The industry sectors, in particular energy & utilities, are characterized by legacy assets in need of upgrade, modernization, and digitalization due to societal, regulatory, and investor pressures. Monitoring and analysis of these critical assets is essential information to be able to optimize and improve performance. With this partnership we have boosted our portfolio with new asset performance management capabilities, driving customers’ operational resilience, energy efficiency as well as simultaneously reducing energy costs and their carbon footprint.”

Jasper Hoogeweegen, CEO of Samotics said, “Our SAM4 technology is delivering significant value to global industrial companies, helping to address the challenges with unplanned downtime and energy waste. With our joint commitment to help customers improve the performance and efficiency of their critical assets, we’re excited to be partnering with Eviden to bring our proven technology to more organizations around the world and help them eliminate unplanned downtime, significantly reduce energy waste and optimize operations.
