Moxa’s industrial secure routers attain IEC 62443-4-2 certification Moxa shared in a press statement that it has achieved the world’s first IEC 62443-4-2 Security Level 2 (SL2) certification for industrial secure routers. This certification was reportedly awarded to its flagship industrial secure routers, the EDR-G9010 and TN-4900 Series. “We are delighted to extend our congratulations to the Moxa industrial router team for their successful attainment of IEC 62443-4-2 Security Level 2 certification for their TN-4900 and EDR-G9010 Series industrial secure routers as the world’s pioneering IEC 62443-4-2 SL2 certified secure industrial routers available in the market,” said Pascal Le-Ray, general manager of Bureau Veritas (BV) CPS Technology Products Taiwan. “This certification stands as Moxa’s resolute commitment to security and their distinguished position in the industrial networking market.” Bureau Veritas (BV) is the global certification body that issued the IEC 62443 certification. The EDR-G9010 Series and TN-4900 Series reportedly employ the Moxa Router Operating System (MX-ROS), a software platform for industrial security routers and firewalls. The latest version, MX-ROS 3.0, provides security protection and user-friendly operational procedures through simplified web and CLI interfaces. It also offers cross-industry Operational Technology (OT) network management features. With security-hardened functions based on the IEC 62443-4-2 cybersecurity standard, the EDR-G9010 and TN-4900 Series are suitable solutions in the automation industry, facilitating data connectivity and offering advanced security features, such as an intrusion prevention system (IPS), intrusion detection system (IDS), and deep packet inspection (DPI), to ensure a high level of industrial network security. As the first line of defence, these secure routers reportedly ensure stable operations, preventing threats from propagating throughout the network.
