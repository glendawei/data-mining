Navigating the Automation Crossroads The Automation sector, including Robotic Process Automation (RPA), is in the midst of a profound transformation, ushering in new opportunities for innovation and specialization. The Automation sector, including Robotic Process Automation (RPA), is in the midst of a profound transformation, ushering in new opportunities for innovation and specialization. Lee Chin Jian, vice president at DAI Magister, analyses the potential risks and opportunities in this dynamic landscape, focusing on the strategic importance of mergers and acquisitions.
 
In today’s digital-first business environment, where technology is ubiquitous and continuous adaptation and innovation are paramount, automation has transcended from a mere technological edge to an operational necessity. The COVID-19 pandemic, far from being an isolated event, has accelerated this shift, compelling businesses to adopt automation with unprecedented speed and urgency. In the post-pandemic era, the adoption of RPA has surged by 50%, with a growing contingent of businesses coming to realise that automation is a foundational component for maintaining operational continuity and efficiency.
 
From 2020 to 2022, M&A activity within the Automation space showed a resilient growth trajectory despite a global tech downturn that took hold during the latter half of 2022. Despite a slight moderation in deal-making activity this year, the sector continues to outperform the broader tech market, declining by around 15% compared to the 40% decline seen in the wider tech sector. This divergence underlines the sector’s resilience and strategic importance as a non-negotiable cornerstone of future business operations. Significant trends are reshaping the automation sector and influencing the strategies of incumbents and emerging players alike. Sector innovators who understand these trends will be best positioned to thrive during this transformative phase. As the RPA market continues to mature, standardisation of basic features of automation tools has made it challenging for vendors to differentiate themselves solely based on their products alone. This has given rise to a certain level of commoditisation, compelling vendors to compete on factors extending beyond basic features like pricing and specialisation.

To set themselves apart, many vendors have introduced more competitive pricing strategies to attract a wider customer base, shifting to subscription-based pricing models, offering better value and simplified budgeting for RPA expenses.
 
In addition, there has been a surge in specialised automation solutions tailored for specific industry verticals and business processes. These niche solutions have emerged in various sectors, such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, enabling vendors to provide added value and foster innovation. Another critical trend across the automation sector is the shift from a tool-centric to an outcome-centric approach. Instead of focusing on the features of their automation tools, sellers are now focused on the impact that automation can have on their customers’ businesses, such as cost reduction, improved efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
 
The outcome-centric approach in RPA aligns closely with businesses’ strategic goals, moving beyond task automation to process optimization and measurable results. By prioritising outcomes, RPA vendors help their customers achieve their strategic goals and improve their bottom line. This shift also enhances the appeal of RPA vendors as acquisition targets, as potential acquirers seek partners that align with their strategic objectives, making them an ideal fit for acquisition. Key risks
Data security
Data security is a paramount concern for sector innovators in an environment marked by increasingly stringent regulations, such as GDPR. Automation tools routinely handle large volumes of data, much of which can be sensitive or confidential. This context underscores the critical importance of adhering to data protection regulations at both the national and international levels. Non-compliance or inadequate safeguards for sensitive information not only subject vendors to regulatory penalties but also present a substantial risk to their reputation and customer trust.
 
Market saturation
In the maturing RPA market, many players are competing for their slice of the market. While this competitive atmosphere fuels innovation, it can also pose valuation complexities for prospective acquirers. The abundance of competitors can make it challenging to assess a company’s true worth, potentially resulting in overvaluation. In such a saturated market, identifying acquisition targets that offer genuine value and align with strategic objectives becomes more intricate, elevating the risk of suboptimal investments.
 
Technological obsolescence
The automation sector is marked by swift technological progress. What’s considered cutting-edge today may quickly become obsolete, rendering automation solutions ineffective. This risk underscores the need for innovators to stay on the leading edge of technological developments to prevent investments in solutions that could become outdated before providing a return on investment. Staying ahead of the curve, foreseeing technological shifts, and adapting are vital strategies to mitigate this risk.
 
Cultural and operational alignment
Mergers and acquisitions are common in the automation sector but introduce challenges in aligning cultures and operational processes. Ineffectively addressing these issues can disrupt the integration process, resulting in inefficiencies and cultural conflicts, hindering anticipated synergies and benefits from the M&A. Managing cultural and operational alignment is a significant risk to address.
 
Strategic misalignment
Strategic misalignment poses a key risk, especially in acquisitions. Acquiring companies that do not align with the acquiring entity’s long-term goals can lead to a lack of synergy and reduced benefits from the investment. Mitigating this risk requires thorough due diligence and a deep assessment of alignment between the acquired company’s goals and the acquirer’s broader strategic objectives.

Mitigation strategies
Adaptability
The automation sector is distinguished by its resilience. Companies within the industry have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to adjust to shifting circumstances in recent years, rendering them appealing targets for acquisition despite the risks. This adaptability is instrumental in surmounting challenges like evolving regulations and technological transitions. To ensure adaptability and resilience into the future, sector innovators should implement agile workflows and a scalable infrastructure. They should also establish effective change management practices and strategic partnerships and engage in proactive compliance adherence.
 
Strategic M&A
In the realm of acquisitions, there is a notable shift towards long-term strategic objectives, emphasising a departure from short-term technological advantages. This strategic realignment aims to mitigate several significant risks associated with acquisitions. When the acquisition process is in harmony with a broader strategic vision, the probability of seamless integration and enhanced value creation is substantially heightened. In the ever-evolving automation sector, the coming years promise a landscape shaped by heightened demand for automation solutions, fostering both fierce competition and rising customer expectations. In response, both established players and start-ups must embrace innovation and specialisation to deliver products with increased tangible value. Moreover, the near future is likely to witness a surge in M&A activities, creating fresh growth opportunities for leading RPA firms.
 
To optimise the chances for favourable outcomes, companies looking to be acquired should take proactive steps and employ the following strategic approaches:
 
Carve out a specialised niche: To avoid commoditisation in the maturing automation market, seek out a unique corner of the market and deliver a specialised solution. Doing so not only shields you from market saturation but also enables you to command premium valuations during acquisition negotiations.
 
Provide outcome-driven solutions: Instead of merely offering tools, prioritise the provision of holistic solutions that drive broader and more impactful business outcomes. Acquirers show a willingness to pay a premium for this value-added approach.
 
Prioritise data security and compliance: Robust data security and compliance measures enhance your attractiveness to potential acquirers concerned about risk mitigation. By emphasising these aspects, you solidify your position in the acquisition landscape.
