Bosch Rexroth names Erwin Wieckowski as president and CEO for North and Central America Bosch Rexroth has appointed Erwin Wieckowski as the new president and CEO of the company’s North and Central American operations. Wieckowski takes on his new role effective from October 1 and is based out of Charlotte, North Carolina. Most recently, Reinhard Schaefer was in charge of this position on an interim basis in addition to his role as a member of the divisional board of management with responsibility for manufacturing. Schaefer will remain in the region to support the transition. “We are thrilled to have Erwin join our organization,” said Schaefer. “I know he will successfully lead this region during a time of significant growth opportunities.” The changes to the leadership team come after the recent departure of Gregory Gumbs on July 1 from his position of president and CEO of Bosch Rexroth’s North American operations.
