Designing Solutions Around Workers During Peak Retail Season By adopting ergonomic and user-friendly technology solutions, retailers can increase productivity, protect workers and insulate themselves from the effects of labor shortages. Peak season presents a unique challenge for retailers. As demand spikes, they must find ways to maintain efficiency, fulfill orders accurately and ensure customer satisfaction. But in their quest for ambitious efficiency gains, executives can't overlook the human worker. It does not have to be an either/or situation. By adopting ergonomic and user-friendly technology solutions, retailers can increase productivity, protect workers and insulate themselves from the effects of labor shortages. Too often, conversations about the future of the retail, warehousing and logistics industries involve replacing human labor with full automation. However, implementing the technology can be fraught with complications, from lack of expertise or employee buy-in to high costs and inflexibility, to name a few. There is no doubt that automation has an important place in the future of retail operations. However, implementing it too quickly without addressing specific business needs can lead to inefficiencies during peak periods when flexibility is essential. As a result, in the short term, the paradigm is shifting to solutions that augment human capabilities.

Organizations are investing in collaborative automation, or "CollaboMation" for short.  To name just a few examples, exoskeletons help reduce the strain on the body from repetitive motions and heavy lifting. Smart warehouse flooring uses embedded LED lighting to indicate picking routes and potential hazards. Environmental sensors monitor temperature, humidity and air quality and automatically adjust these levels for worker well-being. Collaborative robots (cobots) can work safely alongside humans to perform repetitive and dangerous tasks. 
 
Wearable scanners are another great example. These devices empower workers by putting augmentative technology at their fingertips, allowing them to work quickly and ergonomically. They also reduce the time it takes to complete tasks because of their ergonomic nature, allowing workers to focus on more complex tasks. Human-centered solutions offer several benefits. First, they improve efficiency by streamlining operations and reducing errors. For example, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) facilitate transportation and inventory management tasks. Instead of manually moving pallets from packing to shipping, programming AMRs to automatically move goods can reduce transfer times and eliminate the potential for errors such as shipping goods to the wrong area. This streamlines the entire fulfillment process, increases accuracy and allows human workers to use their skills where they are most needed. 
 
Second, these solutions can enhance worker satisfaction by making tasks less strenuous and more engaging. Instead of spending time performing monotonous tasks, human workers can focus on more creative, engaging and value-added work. This not only boosts morale, but can also reduce turnover, a common issue in the retail industry. 
 
Third, human-centered solutions can be more flexible than fully automated systems. Human workers can adapt to unexpected situations or changes in demand, something that automated systems often struggle with. By focusing on enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them, retailers can build a more resilient and adaptable workforce. Then, as automated technology continues to evolve, workers will be better prepared to shift their roles to best deliver value. In times of labor shortages, partial automation can help maintain productivity levels and fill gaps when demand peaks. Rather than expecting more output from the existing workforce, partial automation augments human skills and capabilities, allowing them to increase output with less input. As a result, retailers do not need to sacrifice employee well-being and satisfaction in the name of productivity. 
 
Moreover, partial automation can help retailers manage their inventory more effectively during peak seasons. With real-time data capture, retailers can closely track inventory movement, helping them make informed decisions about stock replenishment, warehouse layout, bottlenecks and more. Designing solutions around workers is a crucial factor in successfully managing the challenges of peak retail season. By integrating collaborative automation into their operations, retailers can boost productivity, enhance worker satisfaction and maintain operational flexibility even during workforce shortages. 
 
While automation has clear benefits, the immediate future of retail lies not in replacing human workers but in empowering them with the right tools and technology and facilitating the collaboration of human and automation technologies.
