FANUC Unveils Updated M-710i Robot Series: Flexibility and Precision FANUC has added a new robot to its M-710i Series—the first addition in 17 years. The new robot features a curved J2 arm and increased rigidity for greater precision. FANUC America has unveiled the latest update to its M-710i series of robotic arms. The addition comes as a long-reach automation solution and is dubbed the M-710iD/50M. The robot arm is the first update to the M-710i robot series in 17 years.    FANUC's M-710i Series is made up of lightweight, medium-payload robotic arms suitable for a variety of industries. The multipurpose series offers robots with slim wrists and a small footprint. The robots in the series have a payload between 12 and 70 kg and a reach of up to 3100 mm. The series is known for reliability, rigidity, and flexible mounting positions. For the first time in 17 years, FANUC has updated its well-established robot series by adding the M-710iD/50M robot. The M-710iD/50M keeps the tried and true parts of the M-710i robots while boasting enhanced capabilities.  Compared to legacy models, one key enhancement of the M-710iD/50M is the curved J2 arm. The curved arm increases the robot’s dexterity and prevents collisions and common interferences experienced by the straight J2 arm. The curve also gives more room in front of the arm for greater workpiece accessibility. The increased accessibility looks to further the lineup's application possibilities.    The new M-710iD/50M boasts greater precision than its legacy models. FANUC was able to increase the precision of the robotic arm by improving the robot's rigidity. With a 20% increase in rigidity, users can expect greater precision and efficiency—a useful feature where repeatability is of primary concern.  The new M-710iD/50M features a 50 kg payload and a long reach of 2,606 mm. There are no exposed reducers in the fully enclosed arm, and the entire robot is IP67-rated for use in dusty or wet environments, especially difficult, harsh manufacturing environments. FANUC has ensured that setup and installation are simple to help expedite onboarding. In addition, the new smart design is maintenance-friendly and includes a slim and stylish arm for the factory floor.    The M-710iD/50M is a multipurpose robot with high precision and a long reach. With its improved rigidity that helps increase the arms' repeatability up to 0.06 mm, the M-710iD/50M can be used in assembly to offer precise, rapid movements, meeting the complexities of modern manufacturing. Additionally, the curved J2 arm increases the M-710iD/50M’s ability to work directly in front of itself, traditionally an area of collisions and interference, adding even more application potential. With these key enhancements, combined with the M-710iD Series’ well-established technology, the M-710iD/50M will open up even greater potential in welding, pick-and-place, palletizing, load transfer, material removal, dispensing, and other applications.
