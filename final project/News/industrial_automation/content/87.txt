Registration now open for Automate 2024 coming to Chicago in May Registration is now open for the 2024 edition of the Automate show, to be held from May 6 to 9 in Chicagoâ€™s McCormick Place. Organized by the Association for Advancing Automation (A3), the free-to-attend show features 750+ exhibitors showcasing the latest in automation technology. A3 shares the 2023 edition of Automate held in Motor City Detroit was a major success. More than 30,000 attendees from all 50 states of the U.S. and 95+ countries around the world gathered at the venue from May 22 to 25 for the trade show, conference sessions, networking and more. The 2024 edition promises to be bigger, says A3, with the 25 percent larger McCormick Place venue in the Windy City. This means more exhibitors and more demos, among other things. The Automate Conference is a major highlight of the show. This exclusive, classroom-style experience puts attends beside professionals who know how to implement, optimize and expand automation. The conference also serves as the North American edition of the International Symposium on Robotics (ISR) sponsored by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). Registration and other details of Automate 2024 are available here. The agenda for the conference is to be announced in fall 2023.
