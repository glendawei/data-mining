Advancements in The Field: Automation Transforms Future Farming Investigate some of the notable recent technological advancements in the field of agricultural automation, providing higher-yielding, long-lasting solutions for modern farming. Agriculture, which includes the science of tilling fields and cultivating crops, is a sector that is experiencing some significant advancements with farmers honing innovative solutions to solve some of the oldest farming challenges and improve the overall yield. Promising efficiency for farmers while aiming at reducing the overall environmental impact, some of the latest innovative solutions are also offering sustainability by implementing automation in the field. In this article, we have prepared some of the latest advancements in the field of agricultural automation, looking into details of their technicality, their practicality, and the farming issues that the innovative solutions aim to address.  TerraClear is a company that provides farming solutions with its innovative rock-picking technology that changes how farmers handle rocks in their farms. Equipped with artificial intelligence and computer vision, the TerraClear rock picker platform works autonomously to efficiently pick rocks out of soil. According to Trevor Thompson, the president of TerraClear, the rock-picking solution is a multi-year project that keeps on advancing to be better than any other similar solution out there. The rock picker is equipped with a rock map that precisely identifies the location of each rock within the farm field and even determines the size of each rock. This rock map data helps in solving the problem faster, offering convenience while saving resources. Available as a service, TerraClear rock picking solution offers reliability for farmers relieving them of labor-intensive tasks and reducing the risk of damage to their farm equipment and even costly repairs. The innovative rock-picking solution also offers flexibility as it can be fitted to existing types of machinery with ease.    Element Aigen is an AI-driven autonomous farming solution developed by Aigen, a company that specializes in providing solutions in robotics and AI-driven agriculture. In a world where AI is taking the course of most of our technology, AI solutions like Element Aigen are becoming increasingly notable. Battling the challenge of using herbicides in farms, which makes food unhealthy and often damages the soil, Element Aigen brings a solution that is autonomous and scalable for healthier crops. Powered by renewable energy sources like the wind and the sun, the innovative solution cuts down the carbon footprints of the fossil fuel consumed in the production of about 9.4 million tons of glyphosate herbicides used globally.    To provide actionable insights, the autonomous solution connects farmers with planetary data using satellite technology. The Element Aigen is offered to farmers as a service that reduces cost, eliminates the use of harmful chemicals in farms, improves yields, and grows crops that are healthy and safe.  The Advanced Manufacturing Research Center (AMRC), part of the University of Sheffield, has shown commitment to agricultural automation with their innovative AgBot, the first autonomous tractor that is commercially available in the UK. Showcased during Wales Tech Week, the autonomous tractor offers more efficiency than traditional tractors boasting autonomy with up to 23 hours of non-stop operation with no supervision. This keeps it a go-to choice for farmers who want to save time as they can plan daily operations and make informed business decisions based on the provided traceability data during operation.    The new agricultural technology aims to address challenges farmers are facing, like inefficient machinery and a shortage of labor. Funded through a grant by the Welsh government, the AMRC’s AgBot promises long-term savings when it comes to fuel consumption and labor while reducing human involvement in accomplishing tasks.  With the viability of these innovative solutions in mind, there is still a long road to travel when it comes to solving agricultural problems with automation. Issues with highly-priced solutions, power, and the provision of environmentally friendly solutions are still factors that many companies are aiming to solve. TerraClear’s rock mapping technology, Element Aigen's chemical-free approach to farming, and AMRC Cymru's autonomous tractor, the AgBot, provide viable solutions for modern agriculture. However, these solutions may come with upfront costs but the promise of long-term service.
