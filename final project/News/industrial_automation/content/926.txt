Inner Space Control: Hai Robotics Announces Automated Warehouse Solutions Increasing warehouse storage density and real-time efficiency, Hai Robotic’s new HaiPick A42T-E2 and HaiPick System 3 offer flexible solutions for managing warehouse operations. Hai Robotics, known for its autonomous case-handling robotic (ACR) systems, recently introduced the HaiPick A42T-E2 and HaiPick System 3 automated warehouse and logistics management systems engineered and designed to address space issues and improve operational efficiency.  Equipped with ChainPick technology, the HaiPick A42T-E2, efficiently pulls totes at speeds of up to 2.7 seconds with its grappling hook. With a five-deep tote storage capacity, Hai Robotics' innovative solution can significantly reduce picking and placing times. Moreover, 60% less space between the totes ensures that every inch of space is used effectively and not wasted. According to Peter Guan, General Manager at Hai Robotics EMEA, these innovative solutions are important, and most businesses nowadays are seeking ways of effectively handling goods in their warehouse storage space and implementing automation to leave room for more expansion. Excited over the HaiPick A42T-E2’s launch, Guan added that the project shows Hai Robotics' dedication to delivering flexible, efficient, and intelligent warehousing solutions while catering to the changing needs of the logistics and warehousing industry.    With the ability to handle up to 50 totes per square meter, Hai Robotics says the HaiPick System 3 increases warehouse operational efficiency by six times due to its ultra-high storage density. The system is also equipped with a Fast-transit K50 autonomous mobile robot (AMR) that operates at speeds of 4 m/s and a grapple hook ACR. Featuring fast implementation and efficient ACR-AMR collaboration, the HaiPick System 3 offers operators a better way to manage rack-bottom totes between racks and workstations, Thanks to the telescopic Grapple Hook ACR, the solution's reach can be extended to accommodate up to five-deep rack arrangement, with a maximum pickup height of up to 10 meters. According to the company, this innovative feature can help warehouse and logistics managers achieve new operating efficiency and performance levels.    For those seeking a better understanding of how automated robotic solutions can help operators control their inner space, Hai Robotics has scheduled a webinar on October 20th at 9:30 a.m. CET.  According to Hai Robotics, the webinar will offer application scenarios and an in-depth analysis of the HaiPick A42T-E2 and HaiPick System 3 operational capabilities. Interested parties can sign up for this webinar here.  Efficient warehouse and material handling operations are key to profitable business. Most of the industry is achieving these efficiencies through automation. There will always be the need for flexible and affordable long-term solutions, and Hai Robotic’s HaiPick A42T-E2 and HaiPick System 3 offer the kind of efficient, high-density automated storage and material handling solutions the industry needs more of to keep the lights on.
