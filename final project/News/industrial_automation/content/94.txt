Deloitte report reveals industrial metaverseâ€™s transformational impact on manufacturing industry Deloitte and the Manufacturing Leadership Council (MLC) jointly released a comprehensive report titled Exploring the Industrial Metaverse. This study delves into the opportunities awaiting manufacturers as they explore the immersive three-dimensional virtual environments of the industrial metaverse. The report outlines how embracing next-gen technology within this digital realm can empower manufacturers to lead ongoing transformations and significantly enhance operational efficiencies. Adoption of the industrial metaverse technologies could help manufacturers build new markets and unlock measurable value, notes Deloitte in a press statement. The outlook for continued adoption of industrial metaverse infrastructure appears strong, as per the report findings. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe the industrial metaverse will fundamentally transform how organizations do business, interact, collaborate, or have value-added virtual experiences over the next five years. Analysis of the anonymous survey results identified a cohort of respondents whose companies are already taking the lead in metaverse implementation. They are likely to have a higher number of metaverse use cases in play; are committing larger investments to their metaverse initiatives; and are more likely to look towards external partners to help deploy metaverse initiatives. Deloitte notes that these pacesetters are more likely to embrace organizational change to spur industrial metaverse adoption. More than half of those surveyed have established a roadmap for a shift to the metaverse and are actively recruiting talent with the requisite digital skills and knowledge. According to the study, cost, talent and interoperability are key challenges among respondents, while cybersecurity concerns stand out as a top potential risk.
