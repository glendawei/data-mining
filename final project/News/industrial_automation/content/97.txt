Grand opening of Rittal Application Center on September 27 A grand opening ceremony for the new Rittal Application Center (RAC) in Mississauga, Ont., is scheduled for September 27 from 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. According to a Rittal press statement, the RAC will open its doors, allowing customers to learn how Rittal and EPLAN collaborate to offer an all-encompassing process that elevates the panel-building production capabilities of customers. The RAC features the brand-new Laser Perforex for automated machining. It reportedly increases the range of projects Rittal can accommodate for its clients. According to Rittal, the RAC is about applications that revolve around the field of control cabinet and switchgear construction. The special thing about it is that customers can experience and get to know all relevant, automated and digitized processes live and on-site in the spirit of “Join. Apply. Grow.” In addition to the experience of automation, attendees can also exchange ideas with other users as well as with experts from Rittal Canada and Eplan. Andre Bousette, managing director of Rittal Canada, Jonas Zelisko, director of operations of Rittal Canada and Roland Younk, managing director of EPLAN Canada, will be in attendance at the event.
