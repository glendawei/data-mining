Vention collaborates with UR to launch coordination motion technology at FABTECH 2023 Vention has announced its latest advancement in robotic control in collaboration with Universal Robots: coordinated motion. According to the company, this technology empowers users to achieve synchronized motion control across six robot joints and a single external linear axis, enabling precise TCP (Tool Center Point) trajectory execution through multiple waypoints at specific times across the robot workspace. Coordinated motion reportedly unlocks a new realm of possibilities for Vention and Universal Robots customers, offering users a way to streamline their operations and enhance their applications. Vention notes that by integrating coordinated motion between its 7th axis and Universal Robots’ collaborative robots, users can reportedly optimize their automated system’s cycle time, maintain a constant TCP and track the TCP to enhance efficiency and throughput. The coordinated motion technology developed with Universal Robots offers multiple solutions for various applications. It caters to integrating robots on a horizontal 7th axis, a vertical 7th axis, and a rotary positioner. This new offering will further broaden the utility of coordinated motion and add a valuable dimension to automation solutions. “It is a great achievement to show at FABTECH the new coordinated motion software developed in collaboration with Universal Robots,” said Anik Roy Trudel, vice-president of product line management at Vention. “This new innovation exemplifies Vention’s and Universal Robots’ commitment to providing our users with cutting-edge solutions that streamline operations and enhance productivity. We are excited to empower our Universal Robots’ customers with Coordinated Motion and looking forward to sharing the impact it will have on their automated systems.” Coordinated Motion will officially be available to Vention and Universal Robots users within the next six months.
