Semilab and Fraunhofer IISB form long-term strategic partnership Metrology equipment firm Semilab ZRT  of Budapest, Hungary has agreed to form a long-term  strategic partnership with Fraunhofer IISB (Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology) in Erlangen, Germany.  Within the framework of the cooperation, a demo lab will be opened with a focus  on developing metrology and inspection solutions for wide-bandgap semiconductor  materials. Semilab describes itself as a strategic metrology supplier and  innovation partner for wafer manufacturers and IC device makers in the  More-than-Moore market segment, providing both in-line and R&D metrology  solutions. Specifically, the firm provides non-contact capacitanceâ€“voltage  (CV) metrology for silicon carbide (SiC), adding that its market share is  growing for epitaxy thickness and resistivity monitoring. Fraunhofer IISB specializes in wide-bandgap semiconductors and  efficient power electronics, combining device expertise with complex  system development, especially for e-mobility and sustainable energy supply. By  bundling its activities in two business units Power Electronic Systems and  Semiconductors, it spans the entire value chain, from basic materials  through semiconductor device, process and module technologies, to complete  electronics and energy systems. As a center of excellence in  Europe for silicon carbide, IISB is said to be a pioneer in developing  highly efficient power electronics, even for extreme requirements. This  extends from material, through processing, to device development, supported by  providing metrology solutions. It is reckoned that the strategic partnership between Semilab and  Fraunhofer IISB will allow the utilization of their respective resources  and global networks to develop innovative silicon carbide processes and  metrologies.
