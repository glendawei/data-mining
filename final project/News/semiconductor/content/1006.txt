Germanium–tin MQW LEDs on 12-inch silicon substrate Researchers based in Singapore, China and  the USA claim the first germanium–tin alloy (GeSn)  multiple quantum well  (MQW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on  a 300mm (12-inch)-diameter silicon (Si) wafer [Shaoteng Wu  et al, Photonics Research, v11, p1606, 2023]. The  deployment on the largest-diameter wafers so far increases the potential for  mass production and reduces manufacturing  costs of complete integrated silicon photonic  systems. Ge and Sn both lie in the group-IV column  of the periodic table, like silicon. This makes them potentially easier to  integrate with mainstream Si-based electronics. However, these materials are  not conducive to light emission, with the narrowest gap between the conduction  and valence bands being indirect rather than direct. Some progress has been  made in the GeSn alloy system in massaging the band structure  so the direct and indirect gaps are more equal, boosting light-emission.
