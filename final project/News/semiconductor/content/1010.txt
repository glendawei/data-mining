LESSENGERS begins volume production of 800G AOCs and transceivers LESSENGERS Inc of Seoul, South Korea, which  provides optical components based on its patented direct optical wiring  (DOW) technology, says that its new 800G transceiver product (800G OSFP SR8)  will begin volume production in fourth-quarter 2023 and begin shipping to  customers. DOW is a polymer-based air-clad waveguide technology that  is particularly useful for optical interconnects in the data-center and  high-performance computing environments. DOW connects active photonic devices such as  laser diodes or photodiodes directly to the optical fiber, providing  high-density and high-speed optical signal connectivity between switches,  servers and other devices within the data center or HPC clusters. This  capability enables several operational efficiencies and economic benefits, such  as: These attributes are said to make the 800G OSFP SR8 and  other products for high-speed active optical cables (AOCs) and  transceivers high-performance, highly reliable and cost compelling. “Demand for optical connectivity in AI clusters is  accelerating innovation,” notes Dr Vladimir Kozlov, CEO & founder of  market analyst firm LightCounting. “New designs of pluggable and  co-packaged optical engines rely on high-density parallel connectivity,  which need new packaging and fiber-coupling methods. Direct optical wiring,  developed by LESSENGERS, is a great example of such new approaches,” he adds. “The use of DOW technology enables us to achieve  high-performance and low-noise optics by its nature, allowing us to streamline  the production process flow with complete automation,” says LESSENGERS’ CEO  Chongcook Kim. LESSENGERS is exhibiting stand MR31 and  booth #306 at the European Conference on Optical Communications  (ECOC 2023) at the Scottish Exhibition Centre (SEC) in Glasgow, UK (2–4 October).
