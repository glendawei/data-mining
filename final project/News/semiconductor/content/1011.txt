Seoul Semiconductor exhibits LEDs at SID’s Vehicle Displays & Interfaces Symposium At the Vehicle Displays & Interfaces Symposium 2023,  organized by the Society of Information Display (SID), in Detroit, MI, USA (26-27 September),  South Korean  LED maker Seoul Semiconductor Co Ltd is exhibiting  its LED products and technologies for future in-vehicle displays, such as 1515, Mini-LED products for local dimming,  and WICOP Pixel Micro-LED,  in line with the evolution of automotive displays, which are increasing in size  and resolution.  The ultra-small 1515 LED product is optimized for full-array local  dimming, which divides the LED backlight into multiple zones that can be  controlled independently. 1515 helps to achieve a high-brightness display with  high contrast ratios, as it can control light output to a very fine  level on the strength of its small size and its performance. In Seoul Semiconductor’s Mini-LED, the backlight chip has been  reduced to smaller than a tenth of the typical size and mounted in large  quantities on a vehicle display, enabling delicate brightness control, a high  contrast ratio, and high color reproduction. Visibility has also been  maximized, considering the bright in-car environment. Seoul Semiconductor claims that its WICOP Pixel is the  world's first full-color one-chip technology that stacks three color LEDs  (RGB) vertically. This allows RGB LEDs to emit light as if they are a single  pixel, enabling not only the uniform representation of colors but also the reproduction  of a wide range of black colors – three times superior to existing micro-LED  devices. “We will continue to develop and supply LED products for future  automobiles that meet our customers demand in these very exciting times for  automotive displays,” says Michel Zwanenburg, executive VP of the IT Sales  Group at Seoul Semiconductor.
