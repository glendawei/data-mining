NUBURU extends independent chairman’s role to executive chairman NUBURU Inc of Centennial, CO, USA — which  was founded in 2015 and develops and manufactures high-power industrial blue  lasers — says that its board  of directors has appointed Ron Nicol as executive chairman. After joining the  firm as a director in 2020, Nicol has been the  independent chairman of the board since earlier this year. In his newly  extended role, he will prioritize scaling commercial efforts as well as  executive administrative functions. Nicol’s executive experience spans over 40 years and is paired with a background in physics and the  Nuclear Navy. He has been a senior advisor to Boston Consulting Group since  2016 where, prior to that, he was a longtime senior partner and managing director leading the Technology, Media  & Telecommunications practice. NUBURU’s CEO & co-founder Dr Mark  Zediker will focus on scaling production capacity to meet existing as well as  expected customer demand. In addition, he will continue to lead NUBURU’s  technology and development efforts centered around the introduction of  multi-kilowatt and single-mode blue laser  systems, as well as identify strategic and opportunistic projects in the  defense and government markets. “Scaling NUBURU’s commercial efforts is critical for the company’s  growth strategy as a public company,” comments Nicol. “Having Ron in an active management position will allow us to  double down on our efforts to scale the business,” says Zediker. “Our  commercial success goes hand-in-hand with production and delivery of  cutting-edge technology.”
