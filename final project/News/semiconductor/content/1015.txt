IQE’s first-half revenue down about 40% year-on-year For first-half 2023, epiwafer and substrate maker IQE plc of Cardiff, Wales, UK has reported revenue of £52m, down 39.7% on a reported basis (and 42.6% at constant currency) from £86.2m in first-half 2022. This was within the revised guidance range of £50–56m provided on 17 May. Wireless revenue fell by 51.9% from £46.6m to £22.4m, due largely to weakness in global handset demand and supply chain inventory build-up. Photonics revenue fell by 27.2% from £38.5m to £28m, due mainly to softness in the handset market and a slowdown in Asian telecoms infrastructure programs. CMOS++ revenue rose by 43.1% from £1.1m to £1.6m, due to growth in silicon-based switches for power control. Operating loss has more than doubled from £7.4m to £19.6m. Adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA (earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) was -£5.7m, compared with  +£12.3m in first-half 2022, adversely impacted by a reduction in sales and under-utilization of capacity, particularly in the Wireless business. Despite halving from £8.3m, adjusted cash inflow from operations  was still £4.3m, benefitting from management of working capital. Total net cash capex and cash investment in intangibles rose from £7.6m to £8.5m, comprising: £5.2m investment in PP&E capex (up from £3.8m) prioritizing high-growth GaN power and display capacity (as set out at the time of the equity raise); £1.7m in purchase of intangibles of (down from £2.3m) related primarily to the ongoing systems transformation program; and £1.6m in ongoing investment in R&D (level with a year ago), focused on power electronics and micro-LEDs. Compared with net debt of £6.7m at the end of June 2022 and £15.2m at end-December 2022, adjusted net funds improved to £5.3m at the end of June 2023. This follows completion of an equity raise of £29.7m (in net proceeds) on 18 May in order to strengthen the balance sheet and underpin strategic investment. Also, on 17 May, IQE refinanced its undrawn multi-currency revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc of £27.3m ($35m), which has been extended to 1 May 2026. “In a challenging macro environment, we have taken decisive action to manage costs and deliver immediate efficiencies and longer-term margin benefits,” says CEO Americo Lemos. The optimized manufacturing plan for improved asset utilization includes: The consolidation of US MBE operations into the North Carolina site is on track to be completed by first-half 2024. Also ongoing is a review into optimizing IQE’s global footprint to improve operational efficiency and profitability. “We are accelerating our diversification strategy with new customer designs in GaN power electronics and broadening our market penetration into the China wireless market,” notes Lemos. “By expanding our customer base across the breadth of our product portfolio and ramping in strategic growth areas, we are focused on improving future business performance.” IQE notes that the current temporary semiconductor industry downturn is stabilizing, with continued pockets of recovery expected in second-half 2023, albeit more slowly than anticipated at the time of the firm’s full-year 2022 financial results. Specifically, IQE anticipates double-digit revenue growth in second-half 2023 versus first-half 2023, and expects to be profitable at an adjusted EBITDA level for full-year 2023. Improvement is expected in 2024 as the supply chain normalizes and customer demand  recovers.
