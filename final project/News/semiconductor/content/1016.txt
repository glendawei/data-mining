Cambridge GaN Devices incorporates individual 2D barcode on GaN ICs Cambridge GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) — which  was spun out of the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s  Electrical Power and Energy Conversion group in 2016 and designs, develops and commercializes power transistors and ICs that use GaN-on-silicon substrates  — claims to be first to incorporate an individual 2D barcode on a  gallium nitride (GaN) IC, which  can be read by a standard, commercial code reader. This not only enables  CGD to scan packaged devices and identify the circuit and the batch but also to  learn exactly where on the wafer each individual die was made, providing vital  data concerning process ruggedness and reliability. The ability to immediately identify a device using a cheap,  commercial barcode reader can also speed up anti-counterfeiting measures, which  will be of interest to companies operating in high-reliability fields, the firm  reckons. “Although we have a great deal of data to prove the  ruggedness and reliability of our ICeGaN HEMTs, GaN is still a relatively new  technology, certainly when compared to traditional silicon for power electronics  applications,” notes CEO & co-founder  Giorgia Longobardi. “By incorporating 2D barcodes we are able to  provide extremely fast feedback to our manufacturing supply chain, which  helps cement our relationships and scale-up for high-volume manufacture.”
