UV LED maker Nitek sues Photon Wave in USA UV LED maker Nitek Inc of Columbia, SC, USA has filed a patent  infringement lawsuit against South Korea’s  Photon Wave Co Ltd in the Eastern District of Texas. Nitek  asserts that LED products made by ams OSRAM GmbH of Premstätten, Austria and Munich, Germany use Photon Wave’s infringing LEDs. Nitek also contends that Photon Wave  has failed to cease selling infringing products, even after receiving  continuous warning notices of the patent infringement. Therefore Nitek is not  only seeking a permanent injunction against the sales of infringing products  but also pursuing three times damages for willful patent infringement. Nitek has  previously won its patent lawsuit against another international LED maker,  and continues its enforcement against other infringers. Columbia-based Nitek affiliate Sensor Electronics  Technology Inc (SETi) (a division of South Korea’s Seoul Viosys that makes UV-A, UV-B and  UV-C deep-ultraviolet LEDs, emitting at wavelengths of 200–430nm) has also  obtained a permanent injunction for patent infringement against UV LED firm Bolb Inc of Livermore, CA, USA, which was co-founded by former SETi employees. The  effects of this permanent injunction order also apply to officers and employees  of Bolb.
