Plasma-Therm acquires Thin Film Equipment Plasma-Therm LLC of St Petersburg, FL,  USA (which makes plasma-process equipment for the semiconductor and compound semiconductor  markets) has acquired Thin Film Equipment SrL (TFE) of Binasco, Milan, Italy, which supplies physical  vapor deposition (PVD) sputtering and evaporation process equipment and high-purity materials for  thin-film applications. “The acquisition of TFE reinforces Plasma-Therm’s expanding  footprint in Europe, a pivotal component of our long-term strategic growth  initiative,” says Plasma-Therm’s CEO Abdul Lateef. “It also helps to  significantly expand Plasma-Therm’s portfolio in the power device market with TFE’s suite of PVD  tools tailored to meet the requirements of MEMS, power, RFID and other  semiconductor applications.” Complementing its existing etch and deposition products and  process solutions, Plasma-Therm says that TFE’s PVD technologies enhance its  ability to meet a wider spectrum of semiconductor manufacturing and R&D  market demands. The added value of  TFE’s workforce expertise in PVD technology and power device market requirements further strengthens  Plasma-Therm’s customer service and support teams, it adds. The power semiconductor market will grow to $6.3bn by 2027, according  to market research firm Yole Group’s  ‘Power SiC 2022’ report.  Plasma-Therm reckons that it is positioned to support this growth with the  acquisition of TFE and the MRC Eclipse  product line, which is used for  depositing metal for interconnects, via fill,  silicides, packaging (C4, die attach),  and other processes. “While TFE will continue to operate independently, we will work  closely with Plasma-Therm to combine our strengths in plasma and PVD process  technology for a more comprehensive product offering for our customers,” says  TFE’s CEO Francesco Terenziani. “The acquisition will enable us to expand our  R&D resources and customer service & support teams globally to deliver  timely solutions to our valued customers.”
