BluGlass receives custom GaN laser order from repeat customer BluGlass Ltd of Silverwater, Australia —  which develops and manufactures gallium nitride (GaN) blue laser diodes  based on its proprietary low-temperature, low-hydrogen remote-plasma chemical vapor  deposition (RPCVD) technology — has received a custom GaN laser  project order from a repeat customer that is a leading USA-based research  laboratory. The order encompasses BluGlass’ multi-mode GaN lasers in custom laser bars for testing in high-power scientific  applications. The bars will also feature custom lenses, attracting a higher  average selling price (ASP). “This custom order further validates our unique go-to-market  approach, and market differentiation,” believes CEO Jim Haden. “Our flexible  form factors and custom  manufacturing capability are helping our customers solve complex challenges and  enable novel applications in large and growing industry verticals. Our  packaging and manufacturing flexibility is also enabling us to establish  ourselves as a partner-of-choice, providing a platform for our lasers to be  designed into new applications as well as growing our early product revenues,”  he adds. “We are very encouraged to receive this order from an existing laser project customer, as we develop our  track-record and progress to larger volume and recurring orders.”
