Umicore collaborates with RENA to enhance germanium wafers Germanium  product and materials solutions supplier Umicore Electro-Optic Materials (EOM) has established a strategic collaboration  aimed at integrating the ACE inception wafer processing solution of RENA  Technologies of Gütenbach, Germany into the ongoing development of germanium (Ge)  wafers for the space solar cell industry. Umicore EOM has  produced epi-ready, dislocation-free germanium substrates for III-V  multi-junction solar cells for many decades, but RENA ACE technology has  emerged as being pivotal for driving development forward, says the firm. RENA’s wafer  processing solution features flexible process performance and single-side,  full-surface processing. Umicore comments that the scalability for mass production  aligns with its application and ramp-up plans. Built on RENA’s  Inception platform, Umicore EOM and RENA have joined forces in a collaborative  development program, aimed at technology enhancement and ensuring a seamless  and efficient transition into mass production. The move is said to be key  to the realization of both companies’ expansion strategies. “The RENA  advanced wafer processing solution plays a crucial role in our manufacturing  process, and RENA’s technology will be a key enabler for the performance of our  Ge wafers,” comments Umicore EOM project manager Jinyoun Cho. “Umicore is a  reliable partner, and we are glad to support their expansion plans with our  solution,” comments Franck Delahaye, manager of business development at  RENA.
