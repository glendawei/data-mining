Gallium Semiconductor makes available first ISM CW amplifier Singapore-based Gallium Semiconductor  — which designs and manufactures RF gallium nitride  (GaN) solutions for 5G mobile communications, aerospace & defense, and  industrial, scientific & medical (ISM) applications — has announced  the availability of the GTH2e-2425300P ISM CW (continuous wave) amplifier, a 2.4–2.5GHz,  300W pre-matched discrete GaN-on-SiC high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT).  The GTH2e-2425300P is said to bring a new level of efficiency for a wide range  of ISM applications including semiconductor plasma sources  and microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) equipment for  synthetic diamond production. “The GTH2e-2425300P sets a new standard for performance and  ease-of-use in 2.45GHz ISM solid-state power design,” comments Roger Williams,  CEO of 3D RF Energy Corp.  “Its internal matching enables a straightforward PCB design, whether that be  for a 400W narrowband design with 76% efficiency or 300W design with 72–74%  efficiency across the entire band,” he adds. “It is well behaved in both class AB  and class C, and its 17dB of gain at  saturated power simplifies driver  requirements.” Operating within the frequency range 2.4–2.5GHz  and powered by a 50V supply rail,  the GTH2e-2425300P yields an efficiency rating that is claimed to set  benchmarks for RF power  capabilities, with a peak efficiency of 76% (pulsed, 100µs, 10% duty cycle).  Measured data shows a drain efficiency of over 72% under continuous wave operation. A fixed tune demonstration board can be ordered by qualified customers. “Engineers are looking for a robust supply chain partner for long-term product availability and  product support,” says Angelo Andres, director of product marketing for Multi-Markets at Gallium  Semiconductor. “We will continue to strengthen our portfolio for the ISM market  to further support our customers.” Encased in an ACP-800 4L  air-cavity plastic package, the GTH2e-2425300P is said to offer excellent  reliability and thermal performance (0.67°C/W) with its Super-CMC (ceramic  matrix composite) flange. It also simplifies integration into various systems,  easing the development process for RF engineers. The GTH2e-2425300P is  available now for order. Gallium Semiconductor is exhibiting in booth 469C at European Microwave Week (EuMW 2023)  in Berlin, Germany (19–21 September).  In addition to the GTH2e-2425300P, Gallium Semiconductor is showcasing three  new 250W L- and S-band radar products and a new DC-12GHz general-purpose  broadband amplifier.
