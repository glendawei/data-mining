Xenics expands operation in  North America to West Coast USA Xenics of Leuven, Belgium (owned by Photonis Group of Mérignac, France since December 2022) — which designs  and manufactures long-wavelength infrared (LWIR)  and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs)-based short-wavelength infrared (SWIR)  imagers, cores and cameras — says that it is starting a new chapter in its 23-year  history by deploying additional resources in North America, consolidating  its efforts to enhance local sales and support for its growing customer base.  This complements its existing resources in the South-East and North-East  regions of the USA. Frédéric Aubrun, senior worldwide VP sales & marketing of Photonis Advanced Imaging business unit,  has re- located to West Coast USA after being appointed as sales director for North America in  order to  focus on customer proximity, increased sales and additional support  capabilities. He assumes responsibility for the North American  local sales and support team management of advanced imaging activities as  well as expanding the company’s footprint, increasing the customer base  and the local resources in the North American regions. The firm says that,  under his management, the team has built a successful track record in Europe  and APAC since he joined Xenics in 2018, in term of customer satisfaction,  support efficiency and market responsiveness. In addition to his responsibility  in the North American market, Aubrun will also continue to support a  limited number of focus sales accounts in the Europe region. The firm notes that, due to the specifics and dynamics of the  camera market in North America, local resources in the same time zone are  critically important to assist users and customers through their evaluation,  test and implementation stages. On top of supplying products, the service and  support provided by the team is expected to add significant value to customers,  users and partners to maximize the performance of their systems at the right  cost. “The expansion of Photonis advanced imaging  solutions in the North American market is a significant step towards our  commitment in providing the best solutions and support to our customers, users  and partners in this important region,” comments Paul Ryckaert, executive  general manager, Photonis Advanced Imaging business unit.
