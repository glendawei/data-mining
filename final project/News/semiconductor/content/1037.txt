III–V Epi  CTO Richard Hogg co-leading European Semiconductor Laser Workshop III–V Epi Ltd of  Glasgow, Scotland, UK — which provides a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and  metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) service for custom  compound semiconductor wafer design, manufacturing, test and  characterization — says that  its chief technology officer  professor Richard Hogg is helping to  lead the 46th European Semiconductor Laser  Workshop (ESLW 2023), hosted on 30 September at the University of Glasgow’s Sir Charles Wilson  Building. ESLW takes place alongside the 49th  European Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC 2023) in Glasgow  (1–5 October). Hogg, who is Professor of Photonics at Aston University, is sharing  the leadership on the ESLW Organizing Committee with Conference chair Dr Scott  Watson, Programme Committee chair Dr Kevin Gallacher, and professor Stephen Sweeney. ESLW’s keynote speaker this year is professor Eric Tournie, from France’s University of  Montpellier. The invited speakers are Alessia Pasquazi of the UK’s Loughborough  University; Sylvie Menezo of SCINTIL Photonics, France; Una Marvet, of Alter Technology in the UK; Dag Schmidt of  Menlo Systems in Germany; Paul Crump  of Germany’s Ferdinand-Braun-Institut; and Kouichi Akahane of Japan’s National Institute of Information and  Communications Technology (NICT). Workshop topics include dynamic phenomena in  semiconductor lasers; long-wavelength lasers, including quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and interband cascade  lasers (ICLs); photonic crystal, nanoscale, and surface-emission  lasers; all-optical processing; new material systems,  structures, and technologies; laser comb  and millimeter-wave generation; optical amplifiers;  photonic integrated circuits (PICs), integrated devices  and lasers on silicon.
