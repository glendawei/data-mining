Mitsubishi Electric to ship  samples of GaN power amplifier module for 5G mMIMO base stations Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi Electric Corp says that on 21 September it will begin  shipping samples of a new gallium nitride (GaN) power amplifier  module that can help to reduce power consumption in 5G massive multiple-input multiple-output  (mMIMO) base stations. Providing  high-speed, large-capacity communications, 5G mobile networks are becoming  increasingly prevalent worldwide, with 5G mMIMO base stations  installed predominantly in metropolitan areas. Since these base stations  utilize multi-element antennas and a correspondingly high number of power amplifiers,  highly efficient power amplifier modules play an important role in reducing  their power consumption and manufacturing costs. In addition, the  power amplifier  module needs to deliver 3GPP-compliant low-distortion characteristics over a  wide frequency range in order to be compatible with multiple  countries’ 5G mobile networks. Mitsubishi Electric’s new GaN power amplifier  module can deliver an average output power of 8W (39dBm) over  wide frequencies ranging from 3.4GHz to 3.8GHz. In particular, due to its power-added efficiency  (PAE) of more than 43%, it is suitable for 64T64R mMIMO antennas (consisting of  64 transmitters/receivers, rather than 32T32R mMIMO’s 32 transmitters/receivers).  The high efficiency and low distortion result from  Mitsubishi Electric’s new GaN high-electron-mobility transistors  (HEMTs). The wideband characteristics, in addition to the high efficiency, are  realized using the firm’s original circuit design and high-density  packaging techniques.
