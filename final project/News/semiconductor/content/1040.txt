Infinera plans ICE-X coherent pluggables and InP  components complying with Build America,  Buy America Infinera Corp of San Jose, CA, USA — a vertically integrated manufacturer of digital  optical network systems — plans  to make available ICE-X intelligent coherent pluggables and compound semiconductor  components that will be manufactured in the USA and compliant with the Build America,  Buy America requirements issued in August by the US Commerce Department  for the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. Leveraging its domestic optical compound semiconductor  fabrication facility in California and testing & packaging facility in  Pennsylvania, Infinera says that its coherent optical solutions enable network  operators to efficiently scale their networks, driving down cost per bit  and power per bit while helping them meet Build America, Buy America  requirements. US-based semiconductor production also provides improved supply chain  security and resiliency, the firm adds. Infinera says that its suite of indium phosphide (InP) based vertically  integrated ICE-X intelligent coherent pluggables provide network operators the  performance, scale and efficiency that is critical to drive down network  operating costs and to enhance service agility. As a critical part of network  infrastructure, the solutions are optimized for metro, middle-mile, and access  and aggregation networks that enable operators to expand their broadband  infrastructures while helping them to address Build America, Buy America  requirements for the BEAD program. “We remain committed to investing in and keeping  optical semiconductor fabrication in the US,” states CEO David Heard. “By  leveraging our vertically integrated US-based development, fabrication and  manufacturing capabilities, we can do our part to enhance national security and  improve supply chain resiliency for important semiconductor technologies.”
