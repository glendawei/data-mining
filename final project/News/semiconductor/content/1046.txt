Luminus’ new Gen 6 COBs reach 150lm/W at 3000K CCT and  90CRI Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA,  USA – which designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology (SST) light sources for illumination markets – has announced  the launch and immediate availability of its Generation 6 chip-on-board  (COB) LEDs with what is claimed to be industry-leading efficacy exceeding  150 lumens per Watt (lm/W) at a correlated  color temperature (CCT) of 3000K and a color rendering index (CRI) of  90, with the highest reaching over 184 lm/W at a junction temperature of Tj=85°C. The use of traditional nitride phosphors in the Gen 6 COBs is  said to deliver high reliability and an expanded operating range as well  as chromaticity stability over temperature, current and time. The COBs are  suitable for lighting applications including retail, hospitality, residential,  commercial, museum, and high- and low-bay lighting. Special color options, such  as Sensus below the black-body curve for whitening warm color temperatures,  AccuWhite color rendering to 97 CRI typical, and hospitality  color points are all available. With light-emitting surface (LES) sizes that range from 4mm to  32mm available in a full range of color temperatures and CRIs, the COBs  can be used effectively for both indoor and outdoor applications.  LM-80 testing confirmed that the parts are capable of achieving  Design Lights Consortium (DLC) premium lumen maintenance, requiring  greater than 90% lumen maintenance for over 36,000 hours of  operation. “Luminus products don’t distort measurement conditions to achieve  these results but rather deliver this performance at industry-standard  operating conditions,” says COB product line director Dave Davito. 
  The product line is now available through Luminus’ authorized  distributors with only a six-week lead time and volume available immediately.
