Navitas launches GaNSafe power platform At a worldwide launch event at the Marriot  Taipei in Taiwan, gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide (SiC)  technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA unveiled GaNSafe, a  new, high-performance wide-bandgap power platform. Navitas has optimized its  fourth-generation GaN technology for demanding, high-power applications in data centers, solar/energy storage and electric vehicle (EV) markets, where  efficiency, power density, and robust and reliable operation are critical. At the launch event, senior VP worldwide sales David Carroll  and senior director business development Charles  Bailley introduced the new GaNSafe platform to an invited audience of over 50  customer attendees, plus industry partners and international media. The new fourth-generation GaN power ICs are manufactured  in Hsinchu by long-term Navitas foundry partner TSMC. At the GaNSafe launch, Dr RY Su, manager of GaN Power Technology at  TSMC, gave a special presentation on the future of GaN. Navitasâ€™ GaNFast power ICs integrate gallium nitride power and  drive, with control, sensing and protection to enable faster charging, higher power density and greater  energy savings, with over  100,000,000 units shipped, and an  industry-first 20-year warranty. Now, the new GaNSafe platform has been  engineered with additional, application-specific protection features, functions  and new, high-power packaging to deliver enabling performance under  high-temperature, long-duration conditions.
