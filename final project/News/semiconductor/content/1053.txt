5N Plus’ AZUR triple-junction solar cells powering largest long-duration energy storage project Specialty semiconductor and performance materials  producer 5N Plus Inc of Montreal, Québec, Canada says that, through its subsidiary  AZUR SPACE Solar Power GmbH, it supplied the triple-junction  solar cells utilized to help deliver  the world’s largest and highest-efficiency next-generation long-duration solar energy storage project, now officially  declared open. RayGen’s flagship power plant in Carwarp, Victoria, Australia was  officially inaugurated and declared open on 31 August, delivering 4MW  solar and 2.8MW/50MWh storage capacity,  making it the world’s largest and lowest-cost next-generation long-duration  energy storage projects, it is  reckoned. AZUR’s high-efficiency solar cells  are key components of Australian solar-and-storage company RayGen’s proprietary  solar technology. Sunlight, concentrated by tracking mirrors onto RayGen’s  solar receiver, is converted by an array of RayGen solar modules, tiled with AZUR cells, into electricity and  by-product heat. The heat offers synergy with RayGen’s water-based  electro-thermal energy storage. “AZUR’s high-efficiency, high-performance solar cells enable RayGen to provide energy on  a large scale, both consistently and on short-notice, with minimal  environmental impact,” says 5N Plus’ president & CEO Gervais Jacques.  “We look forward to continuing to support RayGen as they pursue additional  utility-scale projects critical to the energy transition.”
