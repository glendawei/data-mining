ST to supply third-gen 750V silicon carbide power MOSFET dice to BorgWarner STMicroelectronics of Geneva, Switzerland is to supply BorgWarner  Inc of Auburn Hills, MI, USA (which provides sustainable mobility solutions for  the vehicle market) with the latest third-generation 750V silicon carbide  (SiC) power MOSFETs dice for their proprietary Viper-based power module,  used in its traction inverter platforms for several current and future Volvo  Cars electric vehicles (EVs). “This collaboration  will give Volvo Cars the opportunity to further increase the attractiveness of  our electrical vehicles with longer range  and faster charging,” says Volvo Cars’ chief operating officer  & deputy CEO Javier Varela. “It will also support us on our journey towards  being fully electric by 2030 and strengthen our increased vertical integration  and our control of critical components,” he adds. “BorgWarner  is pleased to partner with ST to supply our longstanding customer Volvo Cars with inverters for  their next-generation of BEV platforms,” says Stefan Demmerle, VP of BorgWarner Inc and president  & general manager, PowerDrive Systems. To fully leverage the performance of ST’s SiC MOSFET dice,  BorgWarner collaborated with ST’s technical team to match their die with  BorgWarner’s Viper power switch, maximizing inverter performance and  delivering a compact and cost-effective architecture. The collaboration targets  the high-volume capability required by the rapidly growing EV market. “We  are committed to expanding SiC capacity and to reinforcing our SiC supply,  including through vertical integration, as we ramp up volumes to support our  global automotive and industrial customers in their shift to electrification  and higher efficiency,” says Marco Monti, president of ST’s  Automotive and Discrete Group. ST’s high-volume STPOWER SiC products are manufactured in its fabs  in Italy and Singapore, with packaging and testing at its back-end facilities  in Morocco and China. In October 2022, it announced it would expand its  wide-bandgap manufacturing capacity with a new integrated SiC substrate  manufacturing facility in Catania, Italy, home to the firm’s power semiconductor  expertise and the site of integrated SiC research, development and  manufacturing.
