SIA Statement on Sanctions on Russia by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—Feb. 24, 2022—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) released the following statement from SIA President and CEO John Neuffer regarding new export control rules announced today in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“The U.S. semiconductor industry is fully committed to complying with the new export control rules announced today in response to the deeply disturbing events unfolding in Ukraine. We are still reviewing the new rules to determine their impact on our industry. While the impact of the new rules to Russia could be significant, Russia is not a significant direct consumer of semiconductors, accounting for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization. The broader Russian ICT market totaled only about $50.3 billion out of the $4.47 trillion global market, according to 2021 IDC data. “In addition, the semiconductor industry has a diverse set of suppliers of key materials and gases, so we do not believe there are immediate supply disruption risks related to Russia and Ukraine.” # # #
