PhotonVentures raises €60m to invest in Europe’s photonic chip start-ups PhotonVentures has launched a venture capital fund aimed at  early-stage photonic chip start-ups and scale-ups. €60m was raised in its  first financing round, with Netherlands-based PhotonDelta as the lead investor (via  the transfer of its portfolio to PhotonVentures) alongside numerous private  investors. PhotonVentures plans to raise a total of €100–150m,  with its final close set for the start of 2024. PhotonVentures is an independent deep-tech venture capital  firm that has been spun off from PhotonDelta, which was founded in 2014  as a growth accelerator for the integrated photonic chip industry in the  Netherlands and Europe. PhotonDelta has since invested in photonics companies  and R&D, establishing a cross-border ecosystem of organizations that  research, design, develop and manufacture solutions with integrated photonic  chip technology. Last year, PhotonDelta secured €1.1bn in public and private  investment to scale up production, build 200 start-ups, create new  applications for photonic chips and develop infrastructure and talent. As strategic partners, PhotonVentures and PhotonDelta aim to  support the rapid growth of Europe’s photonics industry. Leveraging the  PhotonDelta integrated photonics ecosystem to accelerate European start-ups and  scale-ups, PhotonVentures’ investment strategy will prioritize Series A  rounds, providing investments of €1–2.5m each. The fund is planning to  initially invest in 15 European deep-tech companies that have potential to grow  internationally in their sectors. The start-ups should have an integrated  photonics-based MVP (minimum viable product)  connected to the European ecosystem. The PhotonVentures board consists of Joachim de Sterke,  Pieter Klinkert and Rijkman Groenink. de Sterke has a financial, legal and  technical background with long-term investment experience. As co-founder & chief  financial officer of PhotonDelta he was responsible for the entire  investment process and guidance of the young companies in the ecosystem.  Klinkert joined PhotonDelta in 2021. He was previously investment manager at  OostNL and held positions in financing and corporate investment at various  banks. Groenink is a former banker with experience in the financial sector. “There are hundreds of incredibly promising start-ups and  scale-ups driving development and application of photonic chips that need  investment and support to take the next step on their journey. PhotonVentures  fulfils this need; it is the only fund geared directly towards photonic chip  start-ups and scale-ups,” comments de Sterke. “Our aim is to play an  instrumental role in making Europe a global leader in integrated photonics. We  will continue to expand our fund to enable us to invest in scores of start-ups  over the next few years,” he adds. “The integrated photonics industry is growing quickly but is short  of investors with the knowledge and funding to back the sector’s ambitions,”  notes René Penning de Vries, chairman of PhotonDelta’s supervisory board.  “This is why creating the specialized fund PhotonVentures marks a significant  milestone for the photonics industry,” he adds. “By transferring its existing  portfolio, PhotonDelta was able to leverage its assets to attract more funds  and kickstart the creation of PhotonVentures.”
