Toshiba releases third-generation SiC MOSFETs with reduced switching losses Toshiba is now shipping the TWxxxZxxxC  series of ten silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs based on the firm’s  third-generation technology, targeted at reducing losses in a variety of  industrial applications including switching power supplies for servers  & data centers, electric vehicle (EV) charging stations,  photovoltaic (PV) inverters and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).  Devices in the TWxxxZxxxC series are the  first Toshiba SiC products to be housed in a TO-247-4L(X) package with a fourth  pin. This allows the provision of a Kelvin connection of the signal source  terminal for the gate drive, reducing the parasitic inductance effects of the  internal source wire and improving high-speed switching performance. Comparing  the TW045Z120C with Toshiba’s existing TW045N120C (3-pin TO-247) shows an  improvement in turn-on loss of about 40% while the turn-off loss is improved by  about 34%.
