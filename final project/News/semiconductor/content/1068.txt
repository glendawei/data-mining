Toshiba ships first 2200V dual SiC MOSFET module Japan-based Toshiba Electronic Devices &  Storage Corp (TDSC) – which was spun off from Toshiba Corp  in 2017 – has begun volume shipments of what it reckons is the  industry’s first 2200V dual silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET module for  industrial equipment.  Picture:    Toshiba’s MG250YD2YMS3, the first 2200V  dual SiC MOSFET module. Using the firm’s third-generation SiC MOSFET chips and with a  drain current (DC) rating of 250A, the new MG250YD2YMS3 module is suitable  for applications that use DC1500V, such as renewable energy power generation  systems (photovoltaic power systems etc) and energy storage systems. Such industrial applications generally use DC1000V or lower power,  and their power devices are mostly 1200V or 1700V products, but Toshiba anticipates  widespread use of DC1500V in the coming years.
