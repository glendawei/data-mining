EPCSpace adds rad-hard GaN devices in high-current G-Package EPC Space LLC  of Haverhill, MA, USA has  introduced two new radiation-hardened (rad-hard)  gallium nitride (GaN) transistors with ultra-low on-resistance and  high-current capability for  high-power-density solutions that are said to be lower cost and more efficient  than the nearest comparable rad-hard silicon MOSFET. The devices are supplied  in hermetic packages in very small footprints.
