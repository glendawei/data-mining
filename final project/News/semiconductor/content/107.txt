AdvaMed, Semiconductor Industry Association Convene Roundtable on Supply Chain Issues by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—Feb. 16, 2022—Last week, AdvaMed President and CEO Scott Whitaker and Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) President and CEO John Neuffer hosted a joint roundtable discussion that included dozens of industry leaders and supply chain executives from SIA and AdvaMed member companies, as well as senior officials from the Department of Commerce. The participants discussed ongoing supply chain issues for both the semiconductor and medical technology industries and how the two industries can work together to limit the effects of the chip shortage.“Supply chain issues are not unique to any industry, but there are few industries as important to the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans as the medtech industry,” said Scott Whitaker following the roundtable. “I am grateful to SIA and the Commerce Department for joining AdvaMed for this timely discussion. We are fortunate to have partners in industry and within the federal government who understand the importance of this issue for AdvaMed members. This kind of ongoing communication and improved transparency will be critical as we work out short-term supply chain issues and plan for the future.”“In response to the global chip shortage affecting a range of critical industries, including the medtech sector, semiconductor companies have stretched existing manufacturing capacity to its limits, resulting in record semiconductor units shipped in 2021,” said John Neuffer. “To strengthen America’s chip supply chains over the long term, leaders in Washington must swiftly enact $52 billion in investments to strengthen domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing. SIA appreciates the opportunity to meet with leaders from the medtech sector and the Commerce Department to exchange information about supply chain challenges and to discuss further collaboration to resolve them.”
