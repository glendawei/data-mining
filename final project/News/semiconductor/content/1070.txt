Transphorm’s GaN powers first integrated micro-inverter PV systems by DAH Solar Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near Santa Barbara,  CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride  (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion —  says that its GaN platform is  powering the first integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems from DAH Solar Co Ltd. The PV systems are used in DAH Solar’s new SolarUnit product line. DAH Solar credits Transphorm’s GaN FETs with enabling it to produce smaller,  lighter and more reliable solar panel  systems that also offer higher overall power generation  with lower energy consumption. DAH Solar uses Transphorm’s 150mΩ and 70mΩ GaN FETs in the  SolarUnits’ design architecture (both DC-to-DC and DC-to-AC power stages). The SolarUnits are available in  three models with power outputs of 800W, 920W or 1500W and peak efficiencies of  97.16%, 97.2% and 97.55%, respectively. The GaN devices deliver higher  switching frequencies and power density compared with incumbent silicon  solutions. Notably, the two FETs are available in PQFN88 performance packages  that pair with commonly used gate drivers — features that helped DAH Solar to accelerate its design time. “We view Transphorm as an authority in the field of GaN production  and found their advanced GaN FETs to  be the optimal devices for our new SolarUnit line,” comments DAH Solar’s general manager Yong Gu.  “The devices are easy to design in  and offer performance advantages that enable us to continue building on our  legacy.”
