GaN:AlN superlattice UVC LEDs boost light extraction Silanna UV in Australia reports on the use of gallium nitride:aluminium nitride (GaN:AlN) short-period superlattices  (SPSLs) to improve the performance of far-ultraviolet-C (UVC) light-emitting  diodes [Jordan Nicholls et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v123, p051105,  2023]. The team claims a record radiant flux of 17.4mW  for a far-UVC LED grown on sapphire. Far-UVC light sources  are sought for disinfection and sterilization efforts, such as those seen  during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Silanna researchers comment: “The far-UVC  wavelengths below 240nm are an extremely attractive option for this; light in  this range has difficulty penetrating past the outmost layers of skin (the  epidermis), and so exposure poses a reduced cancer risk.” Although AlGaN LEDs are seen as a route to  low-cost, compact UVC sources, there are a number of challenges to overcome. In  particular, as the aluminium content of AlGaN increases, the generated light  becomes more difficult to extract, since the recombination process emits  photons into transverse magnetic (TM), rather than transverse electric (TE),  modes. The light is then predominantly emitted, therefore, parallel and not  perpendicular to the device layers. A further problem for high-Al-content AlGaN  is poor doping  efficiency. The light extraction problem is related to  the ordering of the valence bands (Figure 1).  In GaN, where light emission tends to be  perpendicular to the device layers, the heavy-hole (HH) band is the highest  energy level into which recombination of  electrons from the conduction band  predominantly takes place. In high Al-content AlGaN, by contrast, the  crystal-field split-off hole (CH) band is the highest. Recombination into this  band emits into TM modes.
