Navitas unveiling new power platform at SEMICON Taiwan Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA  says that, as part of its display in  booth J2238 (Hall 1)  at SEMICON Taiwan 2023 in the  Nangang Exhibition Center (TaiNEX) in Taipei (6–8 September) – which it is sponsoring – it is  revealing a new, high-performance wide-bandgap power platform. Visitors can see how the latest GaNFast power ICs  integrate gallium nitride power and drive, with control, sensing and  protection to enable faster charging, higher power density,  and greater energy savings.  Complementary GeneSiC power devices are optimized high-power,  high-voltage, and high-reliability silicon carbide (SiC) solutions. Additionally, Navitas says that it is  showcasing power-system platforms to accelerate customer developments, minimize  time-to-market, and set new industry benchmarks in energy efficiency,  power density and system cost. These system platforms include complete  design collateral with fully tested hardware, embedded software, schematics,  bill-of-materials, layout, simulation and hardware test results. Examples  include: At 2pm on 6 September, as part of SEMICON  Taiwan’s Power and Opto Semiconductor Forum (in room 402, 4F, TaiNEX 1), Navitas’ senior director  of business development Charles Bailley is presenting ‘GaN Power ICs  Increase Power Density in EV Power Systems’. “Breakthrough high efficiency, high  reliability and high power density – all from the new GaN power IC  platform,” according to Kevin Wang, manager of Navitas Taiwan.
