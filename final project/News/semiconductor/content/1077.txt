Instrument Systems joins MicroLED Industry Association Light measurement technology firm Instrument Systems GmbH of Munich,  Germany (which was founded in 1986  and has been a subsidiary of Konica  MinoIta Group since 2012) has become a member of the MicroLED  Industry Association (MIA), supporting the development and implementation of μLED display  technologies. Instrument Systems has been involved  in setting global standards for high-precision spectroradiometric measurements  in the LED industry since 1986. The firm is involved in standardization committees  and associations (such as DIN, CIE) and cooperates with the metrology  institutes. Joining the MIA is a logical continuation of these activities for  the purpose of sharing knowledge and advancing new technologies worldwide, says  CEO Dr Markus Ehbrecht. Founded in 2022  to accelerate the implementation of μLED display technologies, the MicroLED  Industry Association brings together companies, researchers and organizations  active in the μLED industry, and provides a forum for solving common technology  problems, promoting collaboration and sharing information, resources and tools.  The association aims to ensure that the μLED display industry communicates  uniformly and jointly solves technology problems. With its light  meters and spectrally optimized cameras, Instrument Systems offers solutions  for the precise optical measurement of μLEDs. The camera-based 2D systems LumiTop 4000 and LumiTop X150 enable fast, highly accurate and traceable optical  measurements for μLED arrays and displays. In combination with a high-precision  CAS 140D spectroradiometer, adaptive live  calibrations can be realized, based on the spectral properties of the test  specimen. In addition, the measurement can be synchronized with the power  source of the μLED to achieve high speeds and reproducibility.
