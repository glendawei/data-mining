Lumentum’s quarterly revenue falls 3.3% as customer inventory digested Lumentum  Holdings Inc of San Jose, CA, USA (which designs and makes optical  and photonic products for optical networks and lasers for industrial and  consumer markets) has reported full-year revenue growth of 3.2% from  $1712.6m in fiscal 2022 to $1767m for fiscal 2023 (ended 1 July). Specifically, the Optical Communications segment grew by 2.6% from  $1518.5m to $1557.8m, while the Commercial Lasers segment grew by 7.8% from  $194.1m to $209.2m. This was despite fiscal second-half 2023 (and the rest of calendar  2023, it is expected) being impacted by customers digesting large stocks of  inventory that they had built up during IC component supply shortages that  have since eased. Fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 revenue was  hence $370.8m, down 3.3% on $383.4m last quarter and 12.3% on $422.1m a year  ago, although this was above the midpoint of the $350–380m guidance. The Commercial Lasers segment contributed $50.3m (13.6% of total  revenue), down 1.8% on $51.2m a year ago but up 4.1% on $48.3m last quarter. Specifically,  sequential revenue growth was 35% in ultrafast lasers (driven particularly  by new applications in solar cell processing, leading to market share  gain) and over 25% in fiber lasers, offset partially by lower  solid-state laser shipments for mainly semiconductor applications. The  Optical Communications segment contributed $320.5m (86.4% of total revenue),  down 4.4% on $335.1m last quarter and 13.6% on $370.9m a year ago. Of this: There was sequential growth  in quarterly revenue for narrow-linewidth tunable lasers and reconfigurable  optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) across several leading customers and  across all major categories of ROADMs, including low-port-count,  high-port-count and contentionless MxN platforms. With fiscal Q4 revenue for  ROADMs up 30% sequentially and 21% year-on-year, full-year ROADM revenue grew  22%, driven by the adoption of these advanced ROADM architectures. “Our  ultranarrow-linewidth tunable lasers and our advanced ROADMs are key  enablers of our customers’ next-generation network architectures that are just  starting to be deployed,” notes president & CEO Alan Lowe.  During fiscal Q4, there were three greater-than-10% customers (all  in the Telecom market, with no 10% customers in the Consumer market). Due primarily  to the lower revenue, the product mix and the factory under-utilization, on a non-GAAP basis  quarterly gross margin has fallen further, from 50.4% a year ago and 40.8% last quarter  to 36.7% in fiscal Q4 (dragging full-year gross margin down from 51.6% to 43.2%). By  segment: Operating expenses were $102.4m (27.6% of revenue), cut from $104.9m  (27.4% of revenue) last quarter. “In the near-term, we are focused on expense  controls while maintaining crucial R&D to continue to drive the forefront  of innovation as we partner with our customers,” says Lowe.  Quarterly operating margin has fallen  further, from 28.8% of revenue a year ago and 13.4% margin last quarter to 9.1%  margin. Full-year operating income  fell from 30.8% margin to 19.2% margin. Likewise, net income has  fallen further, from $105m ($1.47 per diluted share) a year ago and  $51.8m ($0.75 per diluted share) last  quarter to $40.2m ($0.59 per diluted share),  although this is above the midpoints of the $0.45–0.65  guidance. Full-year net income fell from $449.2m ($6.05 per diluted  share) in fiscal 2022 to $315.3m ($4.56 per diluted  share) for fiscal 2023. Cash from operations  for full-year fiscal 2023 was $179.8m, of which $49.2m was  generated in fiscal Q4.
   In June, Lumentum issued $603.7m worth of  convertible notes due in 2029. Of the net proceeds of $599.4m (after deducting $4.3m  of net issuance costs), Lumentum used  $132.8m to repurchase $125m of its convertible notes due in 2024 and  $125m to repurchase common stock. During the quarter, total cash, cash  equivalents and short-term investments hence rose by $346.4m, from $1667.2m to  $2013.6m. “As we make progress on the integration of NeoPhotonics products  into our global manufacturing footprint and attain synergies without impacting  customer deliveries, we plan to carry elevated inventories over the short-term,”  says chief financial officer Wajid Ali. “However, we expect  inventories to decline by approximately $30m exiting calendar year 2023 as  we continue to focus on cash generation,” he adds. “The current customer  inventory correction cycle will continue through the balance of the calendar  year and, therefore, our shipments will be below end-market demand,” believes Lowe.  “During this transition period, we are tracking ahead of our  previously announced synergy plans, while we continue to deliver on our new  product and technology roadmaps.” For its  fiscal first-quarter 2024 (to  end-September 2023), Lumentum expects revenue  to fall to $300–325m, with Telecom & Datacom and  Commercial Lasers down sequentially due primarily to customer inventory reductions. “We expect overall Commercial Lasers demand to be softer over  the next several quarters due to customer inventory digestion and  macro factors impacting end markets,” says Lowe. “We expect continued  rapid growth in new applications for our ultrafast lasers to partially offset  these near-term headwinds [e.g. in fiber lasers],” he adds. In what have historically been strong quarters seasonally, Industrial & Consumer  is expected to be roughly flat sequentially (and down more than 60%  year-on-year) in both the September and December quarters, due to lower revenue  for 3D sensing applications as a result of the current end-market demand  environment, pricing, and the impact of the additional competitor on a certain  socket opportunity. Telecom customers are saying that they  want to reduce inventory to normal levels. “The confidence that they have in  our ability to produce what they need when they need it, and that the component  suppliers — including semiconductors — are going to be there when  they need it, gives them confidence that they can live with even less inventory  than originally anticipated,” notes Lowe. “We are shipping into our customers  less than they are shipping out to the carriers which, in turn, should take  care of that problem and more normalize as we get into calendar 2024 [after  “depressed” shipments during second-half 2023].” After entering its inventory-correction  phase earlier (in the September 2022 quarter), Datacoms should return to  sequential growth in the September 2023 quarter. “We probably ratcheted back  our capacity more than we should have on Datacom. That’s now in full force to  accelerate the output of our Datacom chips,” says Lowe. “We expect to see  sequential growth in our Datacom chip business through the balance of this year  as well as into calendar 2024… as hyperscale customers prepare to ramp artificial intelligence  (AI) capacity,” he adds. “Within the next eight quarters, could we get back to  $240–260 annually [for Datacoms revenue]? We are putting capacity in  place to do that… We are in the midst of going to larger wafers to address the  demand we have seen in the long-term.” With factory under-utilization lingering through  calendar second-half 2023, September-quarter operating margin is expected to be just 1–4%. Diluted earnings per share should  fall to $0.20–0.35. “We do expect a return to growth in Telecom & Datacom  shipments in calendar 2024 compared to calendar 2023, as customer inventory  levels are reduced and our shipment rate is more in sync with end-market  demand,” says Ali. “Our synergy plan that we communicated at our March investor event  at OFC [the Optical Fiber Communication conference] is proceeding ahead of  schedule in terms of operating expense reductions,” notes Ali. “We  will exit certain manufacturing facilities at the end of this calendar year [in  November–December], which will deliver significant cost-of-goods-sold  synergies over the subsequent quarters [from the January timeframe]. Overall,  we remain on track to the total synergy plan of $80m in annualized savings that  we articulated previously [over the next 18 months], and we have achieved  over half of the savings in fiscal year 2023,” he adds. “With generational  upgrades in the backbone of the network and increased customer activity for AI  in the data center, we expect year-over-year Telecom and Datacom growth in calendar  2024,” says Lowe. “Our focus is on serving a hyperscale cloud market, primarily to  our transceiver customers that we supply to also certainly supply into the  enterprise end-markets,” says Chris Coldren, senior VP & chief strategy &  corporate development officer. “So, again, we’re supplying EMLs [externally  modulated lasers] as the largest product line, and that’s primarily  playing now into the transition to 800G,” he adds. During fiscal Q4/2023,  Lumentum demonstrated the industry’s first 800G ZR module technology. “We will  also have 200G-per-lane EML shipments ramping up in calendar 2024 ramping  [since internal qualification has now been completed], and that’s for a next  generation of 800G transceivers and then the eventual transition to 1.6 terabits  per second [with customer qualifications currently underway].” Lumentum is seeing strong demand for its high-power  continuous wave (CW) lasers for customers utilizing silicon photonic  to build 800G transceivers. To further address the connectivity requirements  for AI and machine learning clusters, Lumentum has also started to deliver  high-speed vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for short-reach  connections between servers and switches in these systems, and it expects to  ramp up these shipments meaningfully in calendar 2024. “We highlighted the VCSELs ramping so that  we have a broader product portfolio as well as CW lasers to intersect the 800G  and 1.6-terabit silicon photonic based approaches,” Coldren says. “Mid- to long-term fundamentals are solid  for our business as we serve the exponential growth in network bandwidth in the  artificial intelligence, machine learning, mobile, carrier and  cloud computing markets,” summarizes Lowe. “New industrial  applications are emerging for our imaging and sensing products, and our  commercial lasers are expanding into high-growth applications beyond our traditional  markets,” he adds. “We are confident we can get back to the  levels of revenue we have had in the past,” says Lowe. “With our model, the  operating leverage is pretty immense. We should see significant bounce back  when we get up to that $400–450m, even $500m in revenue. That’s doable  in the not-too-distant future,” he believes.
