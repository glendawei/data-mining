Wolfson grant to boost Swansea University’s Centre for Integrative Semiconductor Materials Swansea University in south Wales, UK  has received a grant from the Wolfson Foundation (an independent charity with a focus on  research and education)  that will provide a boost to its Centre for Integrative Semiconductor Materials  (CISM). The £500,000 award will support the design, procurement and  deployment of a unique ‘cluster instrument’ the Advanced Semiconductor Wafer  Analytical Capability (ASemi-WAC), which will be housed at CISM and be part of  a project to create a nationally significant Semiconductor Analytical Suite (SAS)  for use by researchers and industrial partners. It is reckoned that this will grow the university’s capability  in the provision of semiconductor expertise and deliver a dramatic expansion in  research breadth, depth and excellence, with a particular focus on semiconductor  technology for enabling Net Zero, and also for emerging applications of  semiconductor devices in healthcare. “Swansea University has a nationally significant and  internationally recognised critical mass in semiconductor research and  innovation which is fuelled by the emergence and rapid growth of our regional  semiconductor industry,” says CISM’s director professor Paul Meredith. “The award for our ASemi-WAC proposal is  vitally important as it will support us in playing a major part in the  much-heralded UK Semiconductor Strategy as part of the CSconnected Cluster  of partners,” he adds. “The UK needs to invest  urgently in semiconductor technologies as their importance to industries as  varied as healthcare and energy becomes ever more evident,” says the Wolfson  Foundation’s chief executive  Paul Ramsbottom. “The ASemi-WAC  project at Swansea can play an exciting role in this R&D effort, and we are  delighted to be supporting it - and to be funding in Swansea again,” he adds. “Semiconductor science and engineering has long been an area of  research excellence at Swansea University,” states professor Paul Boyle, vice-chancellor of Swansea University. “This  award from the Wolfson Foundation will enable us to build upon our existing  strengths and deliver the world-class innovation which is urgently required in  this field, and which is vital for economic growth, job opportunities and the  advancement of energy science in south Wales and the UK.”
