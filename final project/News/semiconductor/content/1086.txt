German industrial customer orders automated Riber MBE 412 production system Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which makes  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources – says that a German  industrial customer has placed a multi-million Euro order for an automated MBE 412 system, for delivery in 2024, to be used  to produce optoelectronic devices. More specifically, the machine is designed  to passivate laser facets, in particular gallium arsenide  (GaAs)-based quantum dot lasers, covering a wide range of  applications: LiDAR, fiber-optic communications, cloud networking, etc. The MBE 412 system is  claimed to be the most suitable 4-inch wafer MBE research and pilot production  tool on the market for III-V and advanced materials. Its modularity enables  both development and production of new products by easily integrating the  various control instruments required. Developed about ten years ago, over 25 MBE 412 systems are currently in operation  worldwide.
