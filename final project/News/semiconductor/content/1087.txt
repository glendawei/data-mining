Transphorm quarterly revenue grows 14% year-on-year to $5.9m, boosted by Government contract revenue For its fiscal first-quarter 2024 (to  end-June 2023), Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures  JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride  (GaN) field-effect transistors  (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion — has reported revenue of  $5.883m, up 14.1% on $5.16m a year ago, and up 84% on $3.192m last quarter due  to the delay in securing a new government contract with the $15m National  Security Technology Accelerator (NSTXL) to manufacture GaN epiwafers under the  ECLIPSE project, recognizing revenue of $2.9m during the quarter. There was hence roughly an equal split between Government contract  revenue (which was up $2.2m year-on-year)  and Product revenue (which was down  slightly from $3.2m last quarter to about $3m). Nevertheless, the firm has achieved continued capacity increases,  with record monthly epiwafer output from its epiwafer operations in Japan, and  released two additional reactors for process development at GlobalWafers’  epiwafer operations. Gross margin was 36%, up from just 5% last quarter, and exceeding  the expected 30–34%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $6.83m, up from $5.43m  a year ago but cut from $7.55m last quarter. Net loss was  $4.5m ($0.08 per share), up on $4.23m ($0.08 per share) a year ago but cut from  $7.24m ($0.13 per share) last quarter, and outperforming the expected  $0.10–0.13 loss per share. During the  quarter, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash fell by $12.7m, from $16m  to $3.3m. But this was due mainly to Transphorm, in April, fully repaying its  $12m loan from Nexperia (and ending its exclusivity for Nexperia in the  four-wheeler electric vehicle segment). Also, this does not include gross proceeds of $7.94m ($7.6m net)  from the rights offering concluded at the end of July. “We are now beginning  our previously announced strategic review of Transphorm with the goal of  maximizing shareholder value, encompassing potential strategic and/or  traditional equity or debt financing, US and Asia-based licensing  opportunities, and M&A opportunities,” says the firm. Subsequent to  the quarter-end, $2.9m in cash was received from the execution of the NSTXL  Government program. Business  highlights during the quarter are listed as: Transphorm has continued to grow its 5-year pipeline opportunity — by 3%  from the previous update of $440m in June to over $450m now. With traction in  design-ins and design wins of the past few quarters, and opportunities nearing  production, the firm expects to resume sequential product revenue growth in  fiscal second-quarter 2024 (to end-September  2023). “Our differentiated and highly patented products/platforms for the  high-power segments are gaining momentum in key targeted market areas — computing,  energy & industrial and EVs,” president, CEO & co-founder Primit Parikh.  “Additionally, the net proceeds from our rights offering, together with an  anticipated non-dilutive debt financing, will enable us to continue to execute  on our long-term growth plans and, along with the strategic review process,  allow for enhancing and maximizing shareholder value,” he adds. “A combination of our wins in the market, our pipeline and our  strengthened balance sheet all will enable us to maximize growth in the  future,” concludes chief financial officer Cameron McAulay.
