Navitas’ revenue grows 35% in Q2 For second-quarter 2023, gallium nitride (GaN) power IC  and silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of  Torrance, CA, USA has reported revenue of $18.1m (exceeding the $16–17m  guidance range), up 35% on $13.46m last quarter. This is also up 110% on $8.6m  a year ago, although this is aided by the acquisition in August 2022 of silicon carbide power semiconductor device designer  and manufacturer GeneSiC Semiconductor Inc of Dulles, VA, USA. “As the only pure-play, next-gen, power semi  company, our leading-edge GaN and SiC technologies are delivering extraordinary  growth in both near-term revenue and our customer opportunity pipeline across  all key markets including electric vehicles (EV), renewable energy, data-center, appliance/industrial and mobile segments,” says CEO  & co-founder Gene Sheridan. Cumulative shipments  now exceed 100 million GaN and 12 million SiC devices. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 41.5% down from 41.6% a year  ago but up from 41.1% last quarter. Operating  expenses have been cut slightly, from $17.8m last quarter to $17m. Net loss was  $8.65m ($0.05 per share), cut from $10.9m ($0.07 per share) last quarter. Despite this, cash and cash equivalents rose from $100.8m to  $177.7m during the quarter, after completing a $2m equity offering. Specific  market highlights in Q2/2023 are listed as follows: During Q2/2023, Navitas’ customer pipeline rose by 30% from $760m to over $1bn, with growth  in both the number of customer projects and revenue potential  across all target markets. For third-quarter 2023, Navitas expects  revenue to grow to $21m plus or minus 2%. Given expected continued strength in  the lower-margin mobile market, gross margin is expected to be relatively flat on  Q2. Operating expenses should rise to $18.5–19.5m.
