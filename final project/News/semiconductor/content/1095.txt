5N Plus solar cells powering Chandrayaan-3 Specialty semiconductor and performance materials  producer 5N Plus Inc of  Montreal, Québec, Canada says that solar cell technology produced  by its subsidiary AZUR SPACE Solar Power GmbH is being used in  the third and most recent Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) lunar  exploration mission. “AZUR solar cell technology is in high demand, and we are  especially excited to have it included in the Chandrayaan-3 mission as it  powers all aspects of the travel, landing and exploration,” says president  & CEO Gervais Jacques. “The 3G30-Advanced is AZUR’s latest qualified solar cell  product and provides the highest end-of-life efficiencies in space,” he claims.  “With various configurations in production, our AZUR R&D team continues to  exceed client expectations with their ability to address challenging conditions  with unique solutions.” Launched on 14 July, Chandrayaan-3 consists of a propulsion  module that takes a lander and rover to the moon. The mission, which began its  orbit of the moon on 5 August, comprises a soft landing on the moon and  exploration of the moon’s surface with the rover to better understand its  composition through experiments and observation. Expected to land near the  lunar south pole region on 23 August, AZUR supplied the 3G30 solar cells  for the propulsion module (758W), the lander (738W) and the rover (50W).
