Skyworks’ largest  customer Apple remained about 64% of total revenue.

Operating  cash flow was $305.7m (taking the year-to-date operating cash flow to a record $1.491bn). Capital  expenditure has been cut further, from $125.1m a year  ago and $45.3m last quarter to $31.3m. Free cash flow was hence $274m.
