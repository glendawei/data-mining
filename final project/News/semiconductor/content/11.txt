SIA Weighs in on Potential Outbound Investment Regime by Matthew Wayland, Global Policy AssociateSIA has long supported policies that safeguard national security without unduly harming commercial innovation, manufacturing, employment, and continued American leadership in critical technologies. Consistent with this stance, SIA recently submitted detailed publicÂ comments in response to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) published on Aug. 13 by the Department of the Treasury regarding the development and implementation of an outbound investment program.On Aug. 9, President Biden issued an Executive Order directing the Treasury Department to issue regulations identifying categories of transactions involving technologies and products in countries of concern that may pose a threat to national security. SIA commends the Treasury Department for seeking industry input over the past several months and framing the ANPRM as questions for stakeholder consultation. As the success of the U.S. semiconductor industry is in our national security interest, it is critical any outbound investment program is appropriately scoped and clearly defined. Our comments make the following recommendations:SIA appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments and will continue to promote industry engagement with the government during the rulemaking process.
