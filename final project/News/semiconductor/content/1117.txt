MOCVD mid-to-long wavelength IR quantum cascade lasers on silicon Researchers based in the USA report 8.1 μm-wavelength quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) grown on silicon (Si) by  MOCVD [S. Xu et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v123, p031110, 2023].  The team from University of Wisconsin Madison,  University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and MicroLink Devices Inc, comments: “There are no prior reports of  QCLs grown by metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) on silicon substrates.” Such integration on silicon could lead the  way to chip-scale, reliable and mass-producible photonic integrated circuits (PICs). The researchers contrast this  with other integration methods such as wafer bonding: “Hybrid integration  methods rely on accurate alignment for efficient waveguide-to-laser optical  coupling, which, in turn, requires tight fabrication processing tolerances.  Direct integration onto silicon by heteroepitaxy enables the potential for  mid-infrared (IR) optoelectronics integrated with mature CMOS-compatible silicon  platforms at low cost and with high throughput.” Mid-infrared QCLs are typically grown on  indium phosphide (InP). The team took  particular care in creating a virtual InP substrate on silicon, using a  combination of molecular beam epitaxy  (MBE) and MOCVD. MOCVD is preferred over MBE in production. The researchers  comment: “The technical challenge remaining is to overcome the defects and epitaxial  growth-related issues, which arise from the large lattice-constant and  thermal-expansion mismatch between native substrates, such as InP and silicon  (e.g. ~8% lattice  mismatch and ~50%  thermal-expansion coefficient mismatch).”  Figure 1: Full 35-stage, lattice-matched  QCL structure, with 25 μm-wide  ridge and lateral-current injection  architecture, grown on InP substrate or on InP-on-Si composite template.
