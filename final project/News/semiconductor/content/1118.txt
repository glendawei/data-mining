Navitas’ CRPS185 3200W ‘Titanium Plus’ server power platform meets demands of AI data-centers Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA  says that its CRPS185 3200W ‘Titanium Plus’ server reference design  not only surpasses the stringent 80Plus Titanium efficiency requirements but also effectively satisfies the  increasing power demands of AI data-center power. The rapid development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing with AI, and Google’s  Bard, has penetrated all aspects of people's lives. New power-hungry AI  processors like NVIDIA’s DGX GH200  ‘Grace Hopper’ demand up to 1600W  each, and are driving power-per-rack specifications from 30-40kW up to 100kW  per cabinet. Meanwhile, with the global focus on energy conservation and  emission reduction, as well as the latest European regulations, server power supplies must exceed the 80Plus ‘Titanium’ efficiency specification. Navitas says that its reference designs  dramatically accelerate customer developments, minimize time-to-market, and set  industry benchmarks in energy efficiency, power density and system cost, enabled by GaNFast power ICs. These system platforms include complete design  collateral with fully tested hardware, embedded software, schematics,  bill-of-materials, layout, simulation and hardware test results.
