Luminus’ CEO Dr Decai Sun retires Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA, USA –  which designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology (SST) light sources  for illumination markets – says  that, after 11 years of service,  chief executive officer Dr Decai Sun is retiring, and executive VP of marketing & sales Mark Pugh has  taken over as CEO. Sun started Lightera Corp  in Silicon Valley in 2012 with  funding from Sanan Opto. Lightera  acquired Luminus in 2013, merging the two firms with Sun becoming CEO. Under  his leadership, Luminus became a profitable LED component company, with a broad  range of applications worldwide. He moved Luminus from Boston to Sunnyvale in  2014 and recently built the worldwide team to more than 200 employees. Mark Pugh has been a pioneer in the optoelectronics industry for  over 30 years, with leadership roles  in business development, marketing and executive management. His career began  with Hewlett Packard in the  Optoelectronics Division, working with LEDs and infrared devices. This  eventually led to an opportunity to represent HP in a new joint venture with Philips that later became  Lumileds. In 2007, Pugh co-founded Xicato, with the goal to replace halogen  lights with LED modules that had industry-leading quality-of-light and all the  benefits of LEDs. In 2015, he joined Luminus Devices as executive VP of marketing & sales, and the  company quickly tripled in sales and turned profitable. “We will continue to further expand our broad product offering of  photonics solutions as well as leverage our Sanan group  relationship to grow our customer base in new markets with new and compelling  semiconductor technologies,” says Pugh.
