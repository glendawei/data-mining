Fraunhofer IAF-led GaN4EmoBiL project targets bidirectional charging for EVs Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Climate Action (BMWK) as part of the Elektro-Mobil program, the three-year  research project ‘GaN4EmoBiL — GaN power semiconductors for  electro-mobility and system integration through bidirectional charging’ was  launched in mid-July, led by Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics  IAF and joined by consortium partners the University of Stuttgart, Robert Bosch GmbH  and Ambibox GmbH.  Picture:    On 17 July, consortium  partners Fraunhofer IAF, University of Stuttgart, Robert Bosch and Ambibox met in  Freiburg for the official kick-off of the GaN4EmoBiL project. The consortium’s goal is to demonstrate an intelligent and  cost-effective bidirectional charging system using new semiconductor devices,  device concepts and system components.
   Bidirectional charging allows electric vehicles (EVs) to be both charged with  electricity from renewable sources and discharged as needed during periods when  no wind or solar energy is being produced. E-cars  can thus serve as mobile electricity storage  units Consumers could use this electricity for other electrical devices  or supply it to the power grid, increasing the  flexibility of the energy system and contributing to energy security.  However, previous technical approaches do not meet the demands for cost and  efficiency, says Fraunhofer IAF. There is a lack of intelligent and  cost-effective bidirectional charging systems to connect batteries, the grid,  local generators and consumers with high efficiency and high power density,  it adds.
