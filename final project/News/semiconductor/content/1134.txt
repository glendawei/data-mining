onsemi to supply EliteSiC MOSFET technology to Magna for EV traction inverters Intelligent power and  sensing technology firm onsemi of Scottsdale, AZ, USA has announced a long-term supply  agreement (LTSA) for its EliteSiC intelligent power solutions to be integrated into the eDrive systems of  mobility technology company Magna International Inc of Aurora, Ontario, Canada  (one of the world’s largest automotive suppliers). Magna’s eDrive systems will hence be able  to offer better cooling performance and faster acceleration and charging rates,  improving efficiency and increasing the range of electric vehicles (EVs).  Additionally, onsemi’s end-to-end silicon carbide (SiC) manufacturing  capability, combined with its ability to ramp production quickly, should  improve Magna’s vertical integration and simplify its supply chain to meet  the growing demand for its SiC-based products for EVs. “With range anxiety still a top deterrent  to EV adoption, our technology enables them to go further, easing the  transition to an electrified future,” says Asif Jakwani, senior VP & general manager  of onsemi’s Advanced Power Division. “Our latest EliteSiC MOSFET  technology enables increased power density and higher efficiency in  traction inverters, resulting in improved gas-equivalent miles per gallon  without compromising driving dynamics and safety.” In accordance with the terms of the  agreement, Magna will also invest about $40m for the procurement of new SiC  equipment at onsemi’s New Hampshire and Czech Republic facilities to  ensure access to future supply. With a limited number of manufacturers and  significant demand for SiC-based designs, OEMs and automotive suppliers are increasingly  looking to secure long-term, reliable supply. “We recognize the importance of securing a  stable supply of SiC material in order to continue delivering innovative and  efficient eDrive systems for our customers,” notes Diba Ilunga, president of  Magna Powertrain. “As the electric vehicle market continues to grow, we  are taking proactive steps to secure access to future SiC supply to help  support our electrification strategy and outpace the competition.”
