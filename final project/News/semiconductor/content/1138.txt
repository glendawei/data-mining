Axcelis ships Purion H200 SiC Power Series ion implanter to Wolfspeed Ion  implantation system maker Axcelis Technologies Inc of Beverly, MA,  USA has shipped a Purion H200 SiC ion implant system to Wolfspeed Inc  of Durham, NC, USA, which makes silicon carbide materials as well as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride  (GaN) power-switching & RF semiconductor devices. The evaluation  system will be used to support the production of power devices for  electric vehicle (EV) applications. “The power  device market continues to grow rapidly and is a key driver of our growth  globally,” notes Axcelis’ president & CEO Dr Russell Low. “We are  pleased to continue to support Wolfspeed’s fab capacity expansion and are  also excited about the potential of this new opportunity focused on  high-current implant applications in silicon carbide power devices,”  he adds. “The  popularity of electric vehicles is only steepening, and Wolfspeed is focused on  scaling our capacity to meet the surge in demand for our silicon carbide  devices,” says Missy Stigall, Wolfspeed’s senior VP of global fab  operations. “We partnered with Axcelis due to their expertise, highly  differentiated features, and process control capabilities that are  essential for power device applications,” she adds. “Together, we will  work to ease supply chain constraints as more and more EVs utilizing  Wolfspeed’s silicon carbide technology are introduced to the market.” Wolfspeed is  currently engaged in a $6.5bn capacity expansion effort to dramatically  increase production. This includes the John Palmour Manufacturing Center  for Silicon Carbide, the world’s largest silicon carbide crystal growth  facility, currently under construction in North Carolina, and the final  build-out of the company’s Mohawk Valley Fab in New York. In  February, Wolfspeed also announced its plans to build a highly automated 200mm  wafer fabrication plant in Saarland, Germany.
