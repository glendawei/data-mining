Qorvo releases new circuit simulation software for power and analog designers Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which provides  core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and defense  applications) has released  QSPICE, a new generation of circuit simulation software that is said to provide  power and analog designers significantly higher levels of design productivity  through improved simulation speed, functionality and reliability. In addition to advancing the state of the art in analog simulation  technology, QSPICE allows designers to simulate complex digital circuits and  algorithms. Its combination of modern schematic capture and fast mixed-mode  simulation make it suitable for solving the increasingly complex hardware and  software challenges faced by system designers, adds the firm. “QSPICE enables an entirely new generation of mixed-mode circuit  simulation,” says Jeff Strang, general manager  for Qorvo’s Power Management  business. “In the past, power designers relied on analog circuits and silicon  power switches. Today, digital  control and compound semiconductors  are common elements of advanced power designs.  Whether an engineer is developing AI algorithms for EV battery charging,  optimizing a Qorvo pulsed-radar power supply  or evaluating the newest silicon carbide  FETs, QSPICE is the perfect platform for innovation,” he claims. Available free of charge, QSPICE offers enhancements over legacy  analog modeling tools including: QSPICE is available at www.QSPICE.com and is actively supported  by Qorvo as well as a robust user community through Qorvo’s QSPICE forum at https://forum.qorvo.com.
