MACOM awarded $4m USAF contract to further develop GaN-on-SiC process technology MACOM Technology Solutions Inc  of Lowell, MA, USA (which designs and makes RF, microwave, analog and  mixed-signal and optical semiconductor technologies) has been awarded a multi-year  contract worth about $4m from the United States Air Force Research Laboratory  (AFRL) to develop advanced semiconductor process technology related to gallium nitride-on-silicon carbide  (GaN-on-SiC). Under the contract, MACOM will conduct R&D on GaN-on-SiC  process technologies used in millimeter-wave monolithic microwave integrated circuit  (MMIC) products. “This award supports our strategy to establish leadership in  high-frequency and high-power MMIC technologies and products,” says MACOM’s  president & CEO Stephen G. Daly. In January 2021, MACOM and AFRL entered a Cooperative Research and  Development Agreement (CRADA) to transfer AFRL’s production-ready 0.14μm GaN-on-SiC process to MACOM’s  Massachusetts-based US Trusted Foundry. This process transfer is complete,  and the technology is now available for production. The newly awarded contract further funds MACOM to develop  performance enhancements over existing GaN-on-SiC technologies to support  next-generation millimeter-wave aerospace & defense and commercial MMIC  applications.
