Infineon adds 650V TOLL portfolio to CoolSiC MOSFET family As digitalization, urbanization and the rise of electro-mobility  continue to shape the rapidly evolving world, the demand for power consumption  is reaching unprecedented levels. Acknowledging energy efficiency as an  important concern, Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany is addressing these megatrends with its  silicon carbide (SiC) CoolSiC MOSFET 650V in TO  leadless (TOLL) packaging. The new SiC MOSFETs are enhancing Infineon’s  comprehensive CoolSiC portfolio and are optimized for the lowest losses, the  highest reliability and ease-of-use in applications such as SMPS for servers, telecom  infrastructure as well as energy storage  systems and battery formation solutions. The CoolSiC 650V high-performance trench-based power SiC MOSFETs are offered in a very  granular portfolio to best suit different target applications. The new family  comes in a JEDEC-qualified TOLL package featuring a low parasitic inductance, allowing for higher  switching frequency, reduced switching losses, good thermal management, and automated assembly. The  compact form factor enables efficient and effective  usage of the board space,  empowering system designers to  achieve exceptional power density,  it is reckoned.
