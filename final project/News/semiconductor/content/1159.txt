NoMIS Power gains USAF award to develop SiC devices for aircraft electrical power systems NoMIS Power of  Albany, NY, USA — which was spun off from State  University of New York Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly) in 2020 — has achieved won an award from the US  Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to develop rugged silicon carbide  (SiC) power devices to support the  electrical power systems of aircraft. NoMIS will develop 1200V SiC power semiconductor  devices (PSDs) through the award. The focus will be on metal–oxide–semiconductor  field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) with enhanced operational  lifetime as well as improved on-state and off-state efficiency at operating  temperatures, resulting in lower losses for power electronics engineers to  manage.
