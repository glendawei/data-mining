BorgWarner to integrate onsemi’s EliteSiC 1200V and 750V power devices into VIPER power modules Intelligent power and  sensing technology firm onsemi of Scottsdale, AZ, USA and BorgWarner Inc  of Auburn Hills, MI, USA (which provides sustainable mobility solutions  for the vehicle market) are expanding their strategic collaboration for  silicon carbide (SiC), making the  total agreement worth over $1bn in lifetime value. BorgWarner plans to  integrate onsemi’s EliteSiC 1200V and 750V power devices  into its VIPER power modules. The  EliteSiC devices join a broad portfolio of onsemi products that are part of the  long-standing strategic relationship between the two companies. onsemi notes that it provides  high-performance EliteSiC technology while maintaining the standards of  quality, reliability and supply assurance needed for the electric vehicles (EV) traction market. The firm adds that its  decades of experience in the design, development and manufacturing of power semiconductor products support adoption  in high-volume automotive applications. “First and foremost, onsemi’s continuous  and strategic investment in ramping SiC manufacturing capacity across its  end-to-end supply chain gives us  confidence in our ability to support the increasing demand for our solutions,  now and in the future,” comments Stefan Demmerle, VP of BorgWarner and  president & general manager,  PowerDrive Systems. BorgWarner’s silicon carbide traction inverters are claimed to  already offer higher efficiency, better cooling performance, and  faster-charging rates in a more compact package than other options for EVs. By  using EliteSiC technology, BorgWarner’s solutions are expected to benefit from  increased power density and higher  efficiency, increasing the range and overall performance of EVs. “The integration of EliteSiC technology in  the traction inverter enables  increased gas-equivalent miles per gallon (MPGe), which helps  alleviate range anxiety — one of the  key barriers to EV adoption,” says Simon Keeton, executive VP &  general manager, Power Solutions Group, onsemi. “With onsemi’s  chip-to-system-level support and a track record  of execution, we are able to provide industry-leading SiC-based solutions to  BorgWarner at an accelerated pace to support its go-to-market requirements.”
