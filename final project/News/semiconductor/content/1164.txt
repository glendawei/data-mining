Applied Materials and Fraunhofer IPMS to create European metrology technology hub Process equipment maker Applied Materials Inc  of Santa Clara, CA, USA and  the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic  Microsystems (FhG IPMS) in Dresden, Germany are collaborating to  create what is reckoned will be Europe’s largest technology hub for semiconductor  metrology and process analysis, aiming to accelerate  research and enhance development projects with chipmakers and ecosystem  partners across Europe, particularly in the ICAPS (Internet of things, Communications, Automotive, Power  and Sensors) market segments. To be located at Fraunhofer IPMS’ Center Nanoelectronic  Technologies (CNT) — which offers applied research on 300mm wafers for  microchip producers, suppliers, equipment manufacturers and R&D partners —  the technology hub is situated in the heart of Silicon Saxony, Europe’s largest semiconductor cluster. The hub  will be equipped with Applied Materials’ eBeam metrology equipment, including  its VeritySEM CD-SEM (critical dimension  scanning electron microscope)  systems, and staffed by Applied engineers and R&D experts.

  “Fraunhofer IPMS and its partners will benefit from access to  Applied’s industry-leading eBeam metrology systems,” comments Dr Benjamin Uhlig-Lilienthal, head of Fraunhofer IPMS’ Next Generation  Computing business unit. “The new  technology hub will offer advanced wafer-level metrology in our industrial CMOS  environment with Fraunhofer IPMS’s  unique ability to loop wafers directly with semiconductor manufacturers,” he  adds. “Our collaborative metrology hub will accelerate learning cycles  and the development of new applications for the Fraunhofer Institute, Applied Materials and our customers and partners in Europe,” says  James Robson, corporate VP for  Applied Materials Europe. “This  unique technology hub will have the capability to test and qualify processes on  a variety of substrate materials and wafer thicknesses  critical to applications across the diverse European semiconductor landscape.”
