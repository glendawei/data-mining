DISCO unveils KABRA process optimized for GaN wafer production Tokyo-based  DISCO Corp – which makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment including  chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) systems and laser-based  ingot slicing equipment and processes – says that, using its KABRA (Key Amorphous-Black  Repetitive Absorption) laser-based ingot slicing method, it has developed a process  optimized for the production of gallium nitride (GaN) wafers that can simultaneously  increase the number of GaN wafers produced and decrease the production time. GaN requires time for crystal growth, and is a  very delicate material as the ingots produced are small in diameter and thin. Conventionally,  the mainstream method for slicing GaN ingots into wafers was to use a diamond  wire saw. However, there  were several problems when slicing with a wire saw, such as the processing  time, material loss at the sliced sections that is thicker than the thickness  of the wire used, and the low number of wafers produced due to material loss  from the lapping process which is done after slicing to planarize the surface.  These led to the wafers being expensive, and has hindered the spread of GaN  power devices, reckons  DISCO. DISCO says that, since the KABRA process was  developed for the production of silicon carbide (SiC) wafers, it has been receiving  requests from many manufacturers to apply this process to GaN as well. DISCO  has hence been putting effort into R&D to realize a KABRA process optimized  for GaN, and is now announcing its readiness for mass production. Properties of the new process are listed as:  Low material loss High  throughput High  yield
