ST begins volume production of PowerGaN HEMTs STMicroelectronics of Geneva, Switzerland has begun volume production of e-mode  PowerGaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) devices that simplify the  design of high-efficiency power conversion  systems. The STPOWER gallium nitride (GaN) transistors are said to  raise performance in applications such as wall adapters,  chargers, lighting systems, industrial power supplies,  renewable energy applications, and  in automotive electrification.
