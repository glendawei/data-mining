Toshiba launches SiC 650V Schottky barrier diodes with forward voltage of 1.2V Japan-based Toshiba  Electronic Devices & Storage Corp (TDSC) – which was spun off from  Toshiba Corp in 2017 – has  launched twelve 650V silicon carbide (SiC) Schottky barrier  diodes (SBDs) based on its latest third-generation technology. Now shipping in  volume, the new devices are specifically intended for use in efficiency-critical  industrial equipment applications including switching power supplies,  electric vehicle  (EV) charging stations and photovoltaic (PV) inverters.  The devices in the new TRSxxx65H series  use new Schottky metal. The third-generation SiC SBDs chip optimizes the  junction barrier Schottky (JBS) structure of the second-generation  products, lowering the electric field at the Schottky interface and reducing  leakage current, hence delivering enhanced efficiency.
