Taiyo Nippon Sanso launches UR26K-CCD MOCVD system for GaN mass production Taiyo  Nippon Sanso Corp (TNSC) of Tokyo, Japan has launched the UR26K-CCD metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system for the mass production of  gallium nitride (GaN). 
As its flagship  production-scale MOCVD model, with fully automated handling of wafers and parts  cleaning, it is reckoned that the UR26K-CCD can increase production efficiency  by about 2x compared with conventional systems.  Picture: Taiyo Nippon Sanso’s new UR26K-CCD  MOCVD system. Compared with the  existing UR26K commercial production GaN MOCVD  system, to boost productivity the new UR26K-CCD is an improved model offering  an upgraded ‘Cassette-to-Cassette Wafer Handling  System’ automated transfer mechanism  and an ‘Integrated Dry-Cleaning System’ for dry-cleaning reactor parts. These features  allow fully automated transfer of wafers inside the unit. Additionally, since  the used parts inside the reactor are transferred within the system by the  transfer robot to the separately installed dry-cleaning chamber and returned to  the reactor after cleaning, the entire epitaxial growth process is handled with  clean parts. This automated cycle eliminates the need to interrupt the  operation of the growth chamber for the cleaning process, which increases  production efficiency by about 2x compared with conventional system.  Growing  GaN-on-silicon wafers can pose significant challenges to achieving reproducible  results, a difficulty attributed to the contamination of wafers due to foreign  material and wafer warping. Integrating the cleaning unit and maintaining the  consistency of the reactor environment should result in improved  reproducibility and higher yield ratios, i.e. lower total cost of ownership,  says Taiyo Nippon Sanso.
