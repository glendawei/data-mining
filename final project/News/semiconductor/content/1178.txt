American Elements to increase production of gallium and germanium Los Angeles-headquartered American Elements says that it  will significantly expand production of gallium and germanium from its Salt Lake City plant to address the announcement on 3 July  by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and  General Administration of Customs (GAC) of export control measures on gallium-  and germanium-related semiconductor raw materials from 1 August. “US domestic  supply will not be impacted by this short-sighted decision of China,” states CEO Michael  Silver. American Elements  says that it will continue to supply its Chinese customers from  American Elements’ manufacturing facilities in Asia.
