Coherent expects minimal to no impact from Chinaâ€™s export restriction of gallium and germanium Materials, networking and laser technology firm  CoherentCorp of Saxonburg, PA, USA (formerly II-VIInc before it  acquired Coherent in July 2022) has provided its initial assessment of the export  restriction of gallium and germanium from China expected to begin on 1August. The firm believes that the restriction will  have minimal to no impact on its sales and prospects due to ample inventories  of these materials at both Coherent and its supplychain partners, and  the ability to source the materials from outside China. In addition, efficient  recycling programs already exist at both Coherent and its supplychain partners, the  firm adds. The company says that it will continue to  monitor and assess any changes in the global supply.
