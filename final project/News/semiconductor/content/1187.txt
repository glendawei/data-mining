NexGen and General Motors to receive DoE funding for GaN-based electric drive systems NexGen Power Systems Inc of Santa Clara, CA, USA –  which was founded in 2017 to design and manufacture proprietary power conversion devices  using patented Vertical GaN (gallium nitride) technologies – says  that its collaborative project with General Motors had been awarded  funding by the US Department of Energy (DoE) for the development of electric drive  systems using its Vertical GaN semiconductors. The joint development  project aims to enhance the efficiency, performance and overall sustainability  of electric vehicles and intends to focus on power electronics  design, motor integration, thermal management and system-level  optimization for electric drive systems. “This collaboration will help us  introduce Vertical GaN-based inverter drive systems to the electric vehicle  market and will help enable auto makers to improve range, reduce weight, and  enhance system reliability,” says NexGen’s CEO Shahin Sharifzadeh. The announcement builds on NexGen’s announcements  in February regarding the availability of  engineering samples for its 700V and 1200V semiconductors. The firm’s  current-generation 1200V, 1Ohm Vertical GaN e-mode Fin-jFETs have  successfully demonstrated >1MHz switching at 1.4kV rated voltage, enabling  continued performance, reliability and efficiency improvements in the EV market.
