AXT to seek permits from China to export gallium and germanium substrate products AXT Inc of Fremont, CA, USA – which makes gallium arsenide  (GaAs), indium phosphide (InP) and germanium (Ge) substrates and raw  materials – has addressed  the potential impact of the announcement of China’s new export control  regulations on gallium- and germanium-related materials, which take effect on 1 August. AXT’s China-based wafer manufacturing subsidiary  Beijing Tongmei Xtal Technology Co Ltd expects to proceed to immediately seek permits from the  applicable Chinese authorities to export gallium and germanium substrate  products. Indium phosphide  substrates are not included in the new export control regulations, so exports  of InP will not require approvals as part of these regulations. In first-quarter 2023, gallium arsenide and germanium substrates exported outside of China  contributed about $4.3m to AXT’s revenue, primarily for consumer, automotive,  display and industrial applications. “We are actively pursuing the necessary permits and are working  to minimize any potential disruption to our customers,” says CEO Morris Young.
