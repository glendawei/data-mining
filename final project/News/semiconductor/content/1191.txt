Transphorm’s full-year product revenue grows 21% For its fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 (to end-March), Transphorm Inc  of Goleta, near Santa Barbara, CA,  USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion — has reported revenue of $3.192m, down  on $4.493m last quarter and $4.927m a year ago. However, this was impacted primarily  by a government contract delay (the  revenue from which will be recognized starting in fiscal first-quarter 2024). Product  revenue was at the targeted $3.2m. Full-year revenue has fallen from $24.05m in fiscal 2022 to  $16.511m for fiscal 2023. However, this was due primarily to an $8m decrease in  licensing revenue. Product revenue rose  by 21% to $14.7m. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses have risen further, from  $4.71m a year ago and $6.02m last quarter to $7.55m. Full-year operating expenses  rose from $18.3m in fiscal 2022 to $24.2m for fiscal 2023. Net loss was $7.2m ($0.13 per share), up from $3.5m ($0.07 per  share) a year ago but cut from $8.5m ($0.15 per share) last quarter.  Nevertheless, full-year net loss has risen from $6.4m ($0.14 per share) in  fiscal 2022 to $24.6m ($0.44 per share) for fiscal 2023. Driven by the lower revenue due to the delay in securing the new  government contract with National Security Technology Accelerator (NSTXL) plus  increased days sales outstanding (DSO), quarterly cash burn has increased.  Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash have hence more than halved during  the quarter, from $34m to $16m. After the end of the quarter, in early April, Transphorm raised $9.3m through the exercise of  existing warrants and a private placement of common stock. Also, in mid-June, it announced a rights offering for  up to $15m of common stock, in which certain key stockholders have  indicated their interest in participating. Also in April, Transphorm fully repaid its  $12m loan from Nexperia, and ended its exclusivity for Nexperia in the  four-wheeler electric vehicle segment. Business highlights during the quarter  are listed as: “We continue to see strong fundamental growth trends driven  primarily by increased design wins for both the high-power and low-power  market segments,” says president, CEO & co-founder Primit Parikh. “These  trends point to the company resuming sequential product revenue growth  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2024,” he adds. “Our differentiated GaN semiconductors lead the industry in  performance and reliability, carrying the only reported broad  power spectrum reliability ratings for GaN power and over  175 billion hours in the field,” he claims. “Our increased  design-ins, the end-customer momentum in ramping GaN, and the recent broad  market excitement in GaN power is driving our desire to commence a  strategic review of various opportunities to enhance shareholder value.” “The past quarter and fiscal year have been extremely important  toward positioning us strategically for future growth,” Parikh believes. “We  expect our recently announced rights offering and the asset-based  debt financing initiatives we are pursuing will significantly improve our  cash position and put us in a strong position to pursue the increased  opportunity funnel and allow us to focus on product innovation, operational  capabilities and collaborative opportunities,” says chief  financial officer Cameron McAulay. During fiscal first-quarter 2024 (to end-June 2023), Transphorm was  awarded the NSTXL contract, resulting in revenue being recognized commencing  that quarter, and DSOs improved to historical levels. Consequently, for fiscal Q1/2024  Transphorm expects revenue of $5.8–6.2m, GAAP gross margin of 30–34%, and GAAP  net loss per share of $0.10–0.13. Transphorm forecasts it will have cash runway into the second half  of September 2023, not including the rights offering, asset-based debt or  any other financings. If the rights offering is fully subscribed and the firm  completes the asset-based debt financing that it is pursuing, it would have cash  runway well into fiscal 2025.
