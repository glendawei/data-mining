Navitas’ GaNSense Control power IC used in GravaStar’s Alpha65 Transformer fast charger Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide  (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA says that its GaNSense Control power IC is used in GravaStar’s  new Alpha65 Transformers-branded fast chargers, which are customized to celebrate the worldwide release of the movie ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’. Measuring only 58mm x 35mm x 55mm  (112cc), each ‘2C1A’ 65W charger has two USB Type C and one USB Type A output, to  fast-charge three devices simultaneously, including laptops, cellphones,  tablets, earbuds etc. The lightweight (128g) design is achieved by  Navitas’ GaNSense Control, which integrates a low-voltage silicon system controller  with a high-voltage, monolithically integrated GaN power IC. For the  Alpha65, the NV9580 QR-flyback primary device is matched with the NV9701 IC for  high-frequency secondary rectification to realize safe, energy-saving power conversion. “The partnership with Navitas let us witness  the enormous potential of GaNSense Control,” comments GravaStar’s founder &  chief product manager Huang Yong. “We’re looking forwarding to deeper  collaboration with Navitas to introduce more, next-generation power devices.” “The success of the Alpha Transformer charger  has sparked our imagination for the future of charger design, with confidence  derived from the high level of integration and valuable features of Navitas’  GaNSense Control,” says Charles Zha, VP & general manager of  Navitas China.
