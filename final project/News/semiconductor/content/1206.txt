ams OSRAM launches third generation of OSLON Compact PL LEDs ams OSRAM GmbH of Premstätten, Austria  and Munich, Germany has introduced the third generation of its OSLON Compact PL family of  automotive LEDs, boosting brightness  by 8% from the second generation. By producing the luminous output required by  safety specifications with fewer LEDs, the new LEDs are said to offer  manufacturers of automotive forward lighting greater value and new design options. As compact LEDs housed in a robust ceramic package, the OSLON  Compact PL products are a common  component of forward lighting  assemblies across all segments of the automotive market, from budget to  premium. ams OSRAM has supplied  about 100 billion LEDs in vehicles  since 1990. OSLON Compact PL  products are said to provide reliable, standards-compliant light output for high- and low-beam headlamps  and for daytime running lamps. Since 2017, ams OSRAM  has increased the luminous efficacy of the OSLON Compact PL product family by 33% (24.6lm/W). The increasing  efficacy enables car makers to reduce the climate impact of operating vehicle lighting systems.  The higher brightness of the new OSLON Compact PL  also gives lighting equipment designers a wider set of options for the choice  of components in the optical assembly, such as light guides. “Higher optical power  output from the same footprint means that automotive OEMs can now do more with  less,” notes product marketing manager  Florian Fink. The new AEC-Q102-qualified OSLON Compact PL is based on ams OSRAM’s  UX.3 chip. It is certified for corrosion robustness to Class 3A.
