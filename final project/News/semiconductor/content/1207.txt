NREL awards $2m in contracts to support development of cheaper, more efficient CdTe solar cells The US  Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)  has awarded $2m to fund six projects to support the Cadmium Telluride  Accelerator Consortium (CTAC). Announced in  August 2022, CTAC is a three-year consortium intended to accelerate the  development of cadmium telluride (CdTe) technologies by lowering the cost  and increasing the efficiency of these thin-film solar cells. NREL  released the request for proposal notice for small projects in  September 2022. The following projects were selected. CTAC is funded  by DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).
