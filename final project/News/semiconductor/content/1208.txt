Monolithic integration of III-V lasers and silicon photonics Researchers based in France, Italy and  Ireland claim the first demonstration of III-V semiconductor lasers grown on a  patterned silicon photonics platform with  light coupled into a waveguide [Andres  Remis et al, Light: Science & Applications, v12, p150, 2023]. The team from University of Montpellier in  France, Polytechnic University of Bari in Italy, and Tyndall National Institute  and Munster Technological University, both in Ireland, report a butt-coupling  efficiency of about 10% and an upper value for the insertion loss of 10dB. The gallium antimonide (GaSb)-based  lasers emitted at a wavelength around 2.3μm. Such wavelengths have applications that include  trace-gas sensing and the light-version of radar, LIDAR. The researchers are seeking to overcome the  roadblock for monolithic integration of lasers with low-cost, large-scale,  fully integrated photonic integrated circuit  (PIC) chips. The alternative approach is heterogeneously integrating  separately-grown III-V epitaxial material, using wafer bonding  techniques. The team comments: “Note that a recent comparison of epitaxial and  heterogeneously integrated GaSb-based lasers revealed superior performances of  epitaxial lasers in terms of threshold current density and maximum operating  temperature. We thus expect the same to be true for the lasers studied here  that are grown on a PIC.” The group also hopes that the techniques  used “can be extended to any semiconductor materials system provided the  anti-phase domain problem can be solved, which is the case with most III–V  systems nowadays, and the various processing steps are established, which does  not pose fundamental issues.” Further, the availability of 300mm epitaxy  systems raises the prospect for scaling up to large-diameter silicon wafer  sizes and mass production of low-cost  laser-powered PICs.
