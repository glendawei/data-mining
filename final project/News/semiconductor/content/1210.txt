Guerrilla RF sampling new high-gain drivers for 5G mMIMO applications Guerrilla RF Inc (GRF) of Greensboro, NC, USA — which develops and manufactures radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) and  monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) for wireless applications — is  sampling the GRF5123 and GRF5124, two new high-gain,  high-linearity driver amplifiers  designed specifically for 5G mMIMO  transmitters. With a rated operating range  of 1.8–5GHz, each device can cover all major mMIMO bands with separate  tunes covering 1.8–2.2GHz, 2.3–2.7GHz, 3.3–4.2GHz,  and 4.4–4.7GHz. “The GRF5123/4 are specialized, high-gain variants of Guerrilla RF’s popular pHEMT driver cores which are  already used in 4G and 5G base-station applications,” says Jim Ahne, VP of  Automotive and 5G Products. “We tailored these specific devices to yield  different gain levels for 64T64R or  32T32R 5G mMIMO platforms. They  adhere to a common 3mm x 3mm QFN-16 footprint that has become the  de facto standard for many existing  mMIMO systems, allowing them to be easily adopted by our customer base,” he adds. Unlike existing competing solutions, the new cores support 5V and  3.3V supply rails. “Utilizing this  lower voltage can lead to a 34% reduction in power consumption with  approximately 2dB reductions in linearity and compression,” says Ahne. “This  lower power rating can be a  compelling tradeoff when considering designs typically support 32 or 64  transmit paths. In 64T64R systems,  reducing the supply rail from 5V to 3.3V for this single core can save over 10W  of consumed power.” When operated at 2.5GHz with a 5V supply and only 100mA of  current, the GRF5123 delivers 37.4dB of gain, 22.9dBm of OP1dB compression,  38.6dBm of OIP3 linearity, and a low noise figure  of 1.2dB. The GRF5124 provides 40.2dB of gain, 23.3dBm of OP1dB compression,  36.3dBm of OIP3 linearity, and a slightly higher noise figure of 1.6dB. Using a 3.3V supply typically reduces the  gain by 1dB and the linearity and compression performance by 2dB. Samples and evaluation boards are available for the GRF5123 and  GRF5124. Prices start at $1.96 (in 10,000-unit quantities, EXW USA).
