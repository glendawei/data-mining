Wise-integration and Savoy launch first GaN charger embedded with e-bike battery Wise-integration of  Meylan, France — which was founded in 2020 and designs  and develops gallium nitride (GaN)  integrated circuits and  digital-control technologies for power supplies — and France-based tier-1 automotive supplier Savoy Group have announced a new GaN charger  for e-bikes embedded with the battery of the new Cocotte electric bike, designed  and manufactured by KILOW (a rebranded  light e-mobility division of Savoy Group). Launched at the EUROBIKE 2023 event  in Frankfurt Messe, Germany (21-25 June), the urbanized e-bike and  on-board charger together are said to free riders of two common  pain-points that they face on the streets: running out of power and packing the  added weight of portable chargers. What is  claimed to be the world’s first GaN on-board charger and Wise-integration’s GaN  devices for e-bikes are a highly integrated solution assembled by Savoy Group. “Our  charger is embedded in the battery itself, making it the lightest, most compact  and convenient charger on the market,” claims Wise-integration’s CEO  Thierry Bouchet. “This  technology enables e-bike users to easily charge their bikes on the go,  wherever they are.” “Anything we take away, be it weight,  electronics or gadgets, actually gives the user something more in terms of  maintenance, ease of use or peace of mind,” says Arthur  Allamand, marketing director for KILOW. Wise-integration aims to extend its GaN  products and solution for power supply and e-bike manufacturers across the  European market. Due to the combination of the WiseWare AC-DC digital controller  and WiseGan GaN device, Wise-integration says it is able to improve power density  to provide more power for embedded fast-charging capabilities.
