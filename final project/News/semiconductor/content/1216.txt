Emerging substrates market growing at 27% CAGR from $63.6m in 2022 to $264m by 2028 Due to the need to improve the  performance and the cost limits, new materials, platforms and designs  are continually being investigated in the semiconductor industry. In the  previous decade, some compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) for radio frequency (RF) and silicon carbide (SiC) for power electronics, have succeeded in competing with  silicon and have entered the mass market.
