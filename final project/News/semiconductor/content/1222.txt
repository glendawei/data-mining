CGD signs global distribution deal with DigiKey Cambridge GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) — which was  spun out of the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Electrical  Power and Energy Conversion group in 2016 and designs, develops and  commercializes power transistors and ICs that use GaN-on-silicon substrates — has signed a global distribution deal with  DigiKey of Thief River Falls, MN, USA. DigiKey will hold  substantial stocks of CGD’s ICeGaN gallium nitride  high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) and related  products. “This agreement is a significant step for CGD as we are scaling-up  the business and building a GaN ecosystem that will help engineers explore and  utilize the benefits of ICeGaN for high-voltage power conversion,” says chief  commercial officer Andrea Bricconi. “DigiKey is very well respected  and a trusted brand, and we are sure that this deal will enable CGD to  penetrate and support new markets worldwide,” he adds. “We are pleased to add Cambridge GaN Devices (CGD) to our  Fulfilled by DigiKey program,” says Missy Hall, VP new market development at DigiKey. “By  including CGD’s ICeGaN series  transistors in our portfolio, DigiKey is delivering even more energy-efficient  options for our customers to choose from.”
