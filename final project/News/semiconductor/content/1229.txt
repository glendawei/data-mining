Guerrilla RF samples new LNA with selectable gain for 5G mMIMO applications Guerrilla RF Inc (GRF) of Greensboro,  NC, USA — a provider of radio-frequency (RF) and microwave communication  solutions for wireless OEMs — is  sampling the GRF2176, a  high-gain, two-stage pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (pHEMT) low-noise amplifier  (LNA) with built-in bypass functionality.  As with other bypass-capable devices in its portfolio, the LNA leverages  patented Guerrilla Armor  technology, which prevents amplifiers from turning on in the presence of large  RF input signals — a critical requirement for guaranteeing  exceptional stage isolation and  minimal impact on a device’s on-state performance. “The GRF2176 builds directly upon the success of our previously  released single-stage GRF2076 LNA with Bypass,” says Jim Ahne, VP of Automotive  and 5G Products. “The high-gain capabilities of this new device will allow our  existing 5G mMIMO customers to  replace two discrete cores with a single, ultra-small component. The GRF2176  core will also serve as the cornerstone of a new line of highly integrated  mMIMO receiver devices which will be sampling later this summer.” By utilizing three unique matching sets, the GRF2176 can be tuned  to operate over all common 5G mMIMO  bands spanning 2.3–2.7GHz, 3.3–4.2GHz and 4.4–5GHz.  The bypass function allows the devices to support two selectable gain modes — a critical feature for many applications  requiring a fast yet simple way to quickly reduce the overall gain in a  wireless system. This flexibility is critical for applications like 5G that  need to quickly shift into a low-gain state to protect downstream blocks from  damaging overdrive conditions, says the firm. When operating in its high-gain mode at 3.75GHz, the GRF2176 draws  only 66mA of current while delivering 32.4dB of gain, 32dBm of OIP3 linearity,  a compression level of 20.9dBm, and a noise figure  of 0.65dB. When in bypass mode, the gain is reduced to 15.8dB, with OIP3 and  OP1dB levels of 24.9dBm and 13.9dBm, respectively. Noise-figure performance  stays relatively constant with a rating of 0.68dB. The GRF2176 utilizes Guerilla RF’s  1.5mm x 1.5mm  DFN-6 package — the firm’s ultra-small packaging  option supporting a common footprint for over 30 devices. The entire family of  parts provides options for addressing different frequency, gain, noise figure, compression and linearity  requirements. Guerrilla RF says that  this modular approach has proven to be extremely popular with its customer base since it provides an exceptional  degree of design latitude, translating directly into design speed and agility. Samples and evaluation boards are available for the GRF2176.  Prices start at $1.89 (in 10,000-unit quantities, EXW USA).
