Guerrilla RF launches ¼W InGaP HBT linear PAs for automotive and 5G infrastructure in 2.5GHz and 3.6GHz bands Guerrilla RF Inc (GRF) of Greensboro, NC, USA — a  provider of radio-frequency (RF) and microwave communication solutions for  wireless OEMs — has released  the GRF5526, GRF5526W, GRF5536 and GRF5536W, the latest in a series of ¼W  linear power amplifiers. The indium gallium phosphide (InGaP)  heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) amplifiers were designed  specifically for 5G wireless infrastructure applications requiring exceptional  native linearity over large 100MHz bandwidths and temperature extremes of –40°C  to 105°C. Spanning frequency ranges of 2.3–2.7GHz and 3.3-4.2GHz  respectively, the GRF5526/GRF5526W and GRF5536/GRF5536W are tuned to operate  within the n7, n30, n38, n40, n41, n48, n53, n77, n88 and n90 5G new radio (NR) bands. The devices  typically deliver 23dBm of linear power over the entire –40°C to 105°C  temperature range while maintaining ACLR (adjacent-channel  leakage ratio) levels of better than –45dBc and EVM (error vector magnitude) levels <1% — all without the aid of supplemental  linearization schemes like digital pre-distortion (DPD). The ability to beat the –45dBc ACLR performance metric without DPD  is critical for cellular applications like home and commercial  repeaters/boosters, femtocells and picocells, as well as cable loss compensators which are used in  conjunction with automotive ‘shark fin’  antennas. In each of these use cases,  the sensitivity to cost, power and size constraints prohibits the use of  elaborate linearization techniques like DPD. Instead, designers must rely on  the power amplifier’s native  linearity to meet the stringent emissions mask requirements imposed by the  latest 5G standards. “The GRF5526 and GRF5536 are strategic additions to our previously  released ¼W PAs,” says Jim Ahne, VP of Automotive and 5G Products. “With their  formal introduction, we now have a complete suite of commercially available  linear PAs addressing all bands targeted by our 5G and automotive customer  base. The GRF5536 variants are particularly noteworthy since they capitalize on  the growing popularity of the C-band —  what many in the industry hail as the most attractive spectrum for 5G  applications due to its ideal blend of propagation coverage and available  bandwidth,” he adds. “The new -W variants within this family are also critical  additions for our automotive business,” continues Ahne. “Select variants of the  GRF55xx family — including the GRF5526W  and GRF5536W — are being qualified for  full AEC-Q100 compliance,” he adds. “By the end of the summer, Guerrilla RF will have introduced multiple  -W variants of its linear PAs in support of a major contract it won back in  November.” The GRF5526, GRF5526W,  GRF5536 and GRF5536W come in  pin-compatible 3mm x 3mm, 16-pin QFN packages.  Samples and evaluation boards are available for all four components. Prices  start at $1.70 for the GRF5526/36 series, and $1.95 for the ‘W’ (AEC-Q100  qualified) variants (10,000-unit quantities, EXW USA).
