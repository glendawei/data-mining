Teledyne e2v HiRel launches RF low-noise VCOs for LEO space applications Teledyne e2v HiRel Electronics of Milpitas, CA, USA (part of the Teledyne  Defense Electronics Group that  provides solutions, sub-systems and components to the space, transportation,  defense and industrial markets) has announced  the availability of a pair of voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with  low-phase-noise performance for low earth orbit (LEO) space and other  demanding applications. Fabricated in gallium arsenide (GaAs) indium gallium phosphide  (InGaP) heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) process technology, the  TDVCO015 and TDVCO027 integrate resonators, negative-resistance devices, and  varactor diodes and are said to offer excellent phase-noise performance over  temperature due to the oscillator’s monolithic structure. The TDVCO015 operates at 13.32–15.20GHz and provides a typical  phase noise of −115dBc/Hz @ 100kHz offset. The TDVCO027 operates  at 23.32–27.34GHz and provides a typical phase noise of −98dBc/Hz @ 100kHz  offset. Both are available in a 5mm x 5mm, 32-lead ceramic QFN  package. “With the need for higher and higher frequencies, many of our  customers have been requesting the ability to provide RF synthesizers in  various higher-frequency bands,” says VP & business development  manager Mont Taylor. “These VCOs are the first in a family of devices that can  support the increasing requirements of our customers for space-qualified  devices.” Devices are available for ordering and shipment now, from Teledyne e2v  HiRel or an authorized distributor.
