Teledyne e2v HiRel launches RF LNAs for LEO space applications Teledyne e2v HiRel Electronics of Milpitas, CA, USA (part of the Teledyne  Defense Electronics Group that  provides solutions, sub-systems and components to the space, transportation,  defense and industrial markets) has announced the availability of a pair  of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) for low earth orbit (LEO) space and other  demanding applications. Combining to span 17–31.5GHz frequency ranges, the  TDLNA2626 and TDLNA2628 are fabricated in a gallium arsenide (GaAs)  process technology that provides lower power consumption and high  gain/bandwidth. Both are packaged in a 4mm x 4mm plastic QFN.
