AquiSense launches smallest UV-C LED water disinfection system AquiSense Technologies LLC of Erlanger, KY,  USA (which designs and makes UV-C LED water disinfection  systems) has launched what it reckons is the world smallest UV-C LED  water disinfection system. The PearlAqua Micro A  deploys the firm’s patented reactor technology and high-volume manufacturing  capabilities into a very small footprint for dispensing applications. “The industry has expressed a need for a smaller unit, treating  dispensing flow rates, but at high  UV dose levels,” says president & CEO Oliver Lawal. “The challenge was also  to simplify the product design to reduce assembly time and cost for very  high-volume OEM customers,” he adds. Central to the PearlAqua Micro A  is UV-C LED technology which,  coupled with innovative reactor design features, provides over 99.99% pathogen  reduction at 0.5GPM (2LPM), suitable for water servers and dispensers. It  features an integrated LED driver, visible ‘blue glow’  option, low power consumption, and  unlimited on/off cycling.
