Aehr receives $13.7m follow-on orders from its lead silicon carbide test & burn-in customer Semiconductor production test and reliability  qualification equipment supplier Aehr Test Systems of Fremont, CA, USA has received $13.7m in orders from its  lead silicon carbide (SiC) test  & burn-in customer for WaferPak full-wafer Contactors to meet their  increased production capacity needs for silicon carbide  power semiconductors for the  electric vehicle (EV) market. This  customer is “a leading Fortune 500  supplier of semiconductor devices with a significant customer base in the  automotive semiconductor market”. “We continue to be excited about this customer’s incredible growth  and production ramp to meet capacity increases from their current customers, as  well as to meet new design wins  using our wafer-level test & burn-in systems and WaferPaks,” says president  & CEO Gayn Erickson. “These orders for a large number of WaferPaks include  both current design capacity increases and several new designs  that are expected to ramp to volume production after their customer  qualification is completed. These WaferPaks are scheduled to be delivered over  the next six months,” he adds. “This customer has a significant installed base of our FOX-XP  wafer-level test & burn-in systems that is growing as we continue to ship  systems to them monthly. Each of the 18-wafer FOX-XP systems requires 18  WaferPaks that each make contact with 100% of the die on the wafers with  parametric measurement and monitoring that allows us to provide 100%  traceability of test coverage and results to them on every die on every wafer.  This is incredibly important to them, as well as other companies that supply  devices to mission-critical applications such as the traction inverters used to  power electric vehicle motors,” he  adds. “FOX-XP system orders are required to increase general  manufacturing capacity, while our proprietary WaferPak Contactors are unique to  each device design. As our customers win new designs from their customers, Aehr  secures orders for new WaferPak Contactors to fulfill these new wins. Over  time, we expect to see our follow-on WaferPak business grow both in absolute  dollars and as a percent of our overall revenue.” “These WaferPak full-wafer Contactors are also shipping in a  configuration that utilizes new patented features that allow optimized  alignment accuracy and alignment speed and throughput using our new fully  automated FOX WaferPak Aligners that began shipping this last  month,” Erickson continues. “The new FOX WaferPak Aligner  comes in both standalone and integrated configurations. In a standalone  configuration, each FOX WaferPak Aligner  can service multiple 18-wafer FOX-XPs in batch mode, while the integrated  configuration of our Aligner docks directly to the front of the 18-wafer FOX-XP  system and allows continuous flow of WaferPak alignment and testing in the  FOX-XP without the need for any operator handling. The integrated FOX-XP and  WaferPak Aligner allow the ability  to support a lights-out operation with full factory automation using automated  mobile robot transport or full overhead material movement of wafer transport  cases (SMIF pods or FOUPs) carrying 150mm, 200mm or 300mm wafers.” The FOX-XP system, available with multiple WaferPak Contactors  (full-wafer test) or multiple DiePak Carriers (singulated die/module test)  configurations, is capable of functional test & burn-in/cycling of  integrated devices such as silicon carbide  (SiC) power devices, silicon photonics as well as other optical  devices, 2D and 3D sensors, flash memories,  gallium nitride (GaN), magnetic sensors, micro-controllers, and other  leading-edge ICs in either wafer form factor,  before they are assembled into single- or multi-die stacked packages, or in  singulated die or module form factor.
