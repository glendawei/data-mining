Qorvo unveils smallest 2–18GHz 10W front-end module Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which provides  core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and defense applications)  has launched what it claims is the  first front-end power module covering the 2–18GHz frequency range. The QPF0219 is a 10W multi-chip front-end module (FEM) that  integrates a transmit/receive (T/R) switch, a limiter, a low-noise amplifier  (LNA) and a power amplifier (PA), making it suitable for electronic warfare  (EW), multi-function wideband arrays, radar and communications  applications. Available in an 8mm x 8mm air-cavity QFN package, the multi-die  QPF0219 offers the optimal semiconductor technology for each functional block  to maximize performance in challenging radar applications, delivering what is  claimed to be exceptional performance in a highly compact footprint. The power amplifier  and T/R switch utilize gallium nitride on silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC)  while the limiter and LNA use gallium arsenide (GaAs) technology. Transmit  power is 10W saturated with 20% power-added efficiency (PAE) and  large-signal gain is 13dB. The receiver noise figure is 4dB,  small-signal gain is 14dB and the P1dB is 21dBm. “The Qorvo portfolio of front-end modules continues to surpass  every performance parameter – power, power-added efficiency and bandwidth  – all in exceptionally compact packages,” says Doug Bostrom, general manager  of Qorvo’s Defense & Aerospace group in the High-Performance  Analog business. “These newest additions reflect our continued commitment to  providing defense and communication system designers with the  highest-performing solutions that reduce component count, footprint and costs.” QPF0219 samples and production devices are available from Qorvo  and authorized distributors.
