AlScN ferroelectric FETs for monolithic 3D NVM integration Researchers in the USA, Korea and Saudi Arabia report on the performance of field-effect  transistors (FETs) using aluminium scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectric (FE) to give  non-volatile memory (NVM) operation [Kwan-Ho Kim et al, Nature Nanotechnology, published online  22 May 2023]. The team from University of Pennsylvania  in  the USA, Hanyang University ERICA in  South Korea, Pennsylvania State University in the USA, King Abdulaziz University and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology  in Saudi Arabia, and University of Tokyo  in Japan comment: “The stable memory performance of the FE-FETs, combined with  their scalability and low-temperature integration, make a promising case for  vertical heterointegration with silicon CMOS logic transistors.” The researchers see such monolithic three-dimensional  (M3D) integration of NVM with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)  logic (‘compute-in-memory’) as overcoming data processing  bottlenecks arising from placing the various levels of memory at varying  distances with different communication speeds.
