Guerrilla RF ships 175 millionth RFIC/MMIC Guerrilla RF Inc (GRF) of Greensboro, NC, USA — a  provider of radio-frequency (RF) and microwave communication solutions  for wireless OEMs — has shipped its 175 millionth RFIC/MMIC  (radio-frequency integrated circuit/monolithic microwave integrated circuit).  This represents a 17% increase in lifetime shipments since reaching the 150 million  mark just seven months ago. Guerrilla RF says that, since its founding in 2013, it has  experienced rapid growth in multiple markets including wireless infrastructure,  automotive infotainment, RFID, and wireless audio. The firm has more than 120  products in its growing catalog business designed by its engineers and design  staff that service 300+ customers, many of which are Fortune 500  companies. “Guerrilla RF’s stellar performance and increase in shipments  happened in a backdrop where the general semiconductor and RF industry has been  experiencing considerable slowdowns and headwinds,” notes chief business officer  Kellie Chong. “The first quarter of 2023 was the second largest quarter in the  company’s history even as backlog increased 30% year-over-year and 2022 turned  out to be a record year in terms of revenues. We have achieved this by  continuing to execute our market diversification strategy entering into new  verticals that include satellite communications, aerospace and defense,” she  adds. “Though general market visibility may be limited, we continue to  outperform the market, underpinned by the breadth of our product portfolio,  depth of wireless expertise, and focus on RF innovation and performance  combined with robust customer support.”
