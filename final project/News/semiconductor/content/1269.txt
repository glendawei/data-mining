Lumileds launches CS range, joining Core and CX ranges of CoB LEDs Since there are no industry standards for the footprint or board  size for chip-on-board (CoB) LEDs, over the years companies that manufacture  CoB holders and optics have largely designed their products to support the  three board formats that are widely adopted by lighting manufacturers, notes LED product  and lighting maker Lumileds of San Jose,  CA, USA. However, the firm says that, with its introduction of LUXEON  CS CoBs, it now offers a full range of LUXEON CoBs in each of the common  board footprints. “OEMs choose to implement LUXEON CoBs for better efficacy,  color stability and/or reliability, but they don’t want to have to  redesign their system,” says global product manager Noman Rangwala. “Now,  with the CS CoB range, it’s easy for lighting manufacturers using many of  the common square board configurations to switch to LUXEON.” The LUXEON CS CoBs incorporate all  the advances that Lumileds has implemented and match the performance of the  firm’s Core and CX CoBs. The CS range is a general-purpose, high-performance  CoB portfolio. The CS Pro CoBs are spectrally tuned for retail lighting  where a “brighter and sharper” effect on merchandise is desired. The CS HE  delivers even higher levels of efficacy for applications where energy  efficiency is the driving characteristic. The new LUXEON CS range CoBs are  available now through Lumileds’ global distribution network.
