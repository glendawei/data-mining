CEA-Leti proof of concept demonstrates higher electrons mobility in germanium tin than in silicon or germanium Micro/nanotechnology  R&D center CEA-Leti of Grenoble, France has demonstrated that  electrons and other charge carriers can move faster in germanium tin than in silicon or germanium,  enabling lower operation voltages  and smaller footprints in vertical devices than in planar devices. This  proof-of-concept means that vertical transistors made of germanium tin are promising candidates for future  low-power, high-performance chips and possibly quantum computers. Germaniumâ€“tin transistors have an electron  mobility that is 2.5 times higher than a comparable transistor made of pure  germanium. GeSn is otherwise compatible with existing CMOS chip fabrication processes. Because germanium  and tin both come from the same group of the periodic table as silicon, these  transistors could be integrated directly into conventional silicon chips with  existing production lines.
