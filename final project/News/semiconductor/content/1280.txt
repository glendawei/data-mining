PRFI’s 150th MMIC design moves to production PRFI Ltd of Cambridge, UK (which  designs and develops RFICs, MMICs and microwave/millimeter-wave modules) says that its 150th custom MMIC design,  a low-current mmWave gain block, has  moved to production. The firm’s list of clients includes Samsung, Sony, Analog Devices,  BAE Systems and Qorvo. The milestone MMIC provides a small-signal gain of 17dB  across an operating range of 23–29.5GHz from a very low current consumption  of just 10mA. It is housed in a low-cost 3mm x 3mm QFN package  and is fully matched to 50Ω, making its use very straightforward, says PRFI.  The part was designed for CML Microcircuits’ SµRF product range, and is  commercially available as the CMX90B702. A companion part has also been  designed by PRFI, which has similar gain with the same very low 10mA current consumption  and covers 17–23GHz. “The 10mA current consumption is an industry-leading figure  and the two parts we developed cover 17–29GHz, making them very useful building blocks  in a wide range of applications,” says PRFI’s CEO Liam Devlin. “We were pleased  that we could use our innovative design techniques to create a solution able to  reduce the current to such low levels while still covering a significant  operating band with a good level of gain.” PRFI is exhibiting in booth 1820  at the International Microwave Symposium (IMS 2023)  in San Diego, CA, USA (13–15 June).
