After 23% drop in 23% in 2022, LED chip market to rebound by 5% to $2.92bn in 2023 Market research firm TrendForce has reported a significant  decline in global LED demand throughout 2022, resulting in a noticeable  downturn in both LED lighting and video wall markets. The industry  was faced with an LED chip surplus, which led to a continuous drop in  prices throughout the year. The combined impact of volume and price reduction resulted in a  sharp 22.9% annual decrease in the global LED chips market in 2022, shrinking  to just US$2.78bn. Despite this challenging landscape, it is predicted that the  LED industry will recover in 2023, driven primarily by a resurgence in the LED lighting  market. The anticipated rebound could boost LED chip production by 5% to  US$2.92bn for 2023.  LED commercial lighting is expected to lead the comeback in the  broader LED lighting market. From a supply chain perspective, the LED lighting  industry hit a low point in 2018, leading to an exodus of several small- and  medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, some lighting LED chip manufacturers  have been consistently transitioning into more profitable sectors such as  display technology. This shift resulted in reduced supply and correspondingly  lower inventory levels.
