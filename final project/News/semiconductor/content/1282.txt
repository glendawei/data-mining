Porotech wins People’s Choice Award for Best New Display Component Porotech (a spin off from the Cambridge Centre for Gallium Nitride  at the UK’s University of Cambridge that has developed porous GaN material) has won the People’s Choice Award for Best New Display  Component at Display Week 2023 in Los Angeles,  CA, USA. What is claimed  to be the first single-panel, full-color micro-display suitable for augmented reality (AR) applications, the  micro-display is based on Porotech’s Dynamic Pixel Tuning  (DPT) technology, where DPT micro-LED pixels can emit any visible color when  driven with a specific current density.  Having already demonstrated how a DPT pixel can create a full range of visible  colors, Porotech unveiled the new active-matrix 0.26-inch micro-LED display  offering 1280x720 resolution, which utilizes a proprietary driving method  developed by Porotech that rapidly displays red, green and blue light to enable  a full-color RGB display and richly saturated colors. “This new  single-panel full-color micro-display marks a significant milestone for  Porotech and the entire micro-LED industry, as only DPT pixels can meet the specification,  performance, reliability and cost required for AR glasses,” reckons Porotech  founder & CEO Tongtong Zhu. “Also, Porotech’s DPT technology opens the  market for additional display applications using micro-LEDs beyond AR/VR,  including smart watches, smart phones, tablets, flat-panel TVs to large-panel displays for  commercial outdoor signage.”
