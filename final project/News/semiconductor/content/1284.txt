Tektronix releases oscilloscope-based Double Pulse Test solution Test, measurement and monitoring solutions supplier  Tektronix Inc of Beaverton, OR, USA has announced a new release of  its Double Pulse Test (WBG-DPT)  solution (available now for global customers). With new wide-bandgap switching  devices enabling significant advances in electric vehicles,  solar energy and industrial  controls, the WBG-DPT solution has the ability to provide automated, repeatable  and accurate measurements on wide-bandgap devices such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) MOSFETs, says the firm. Designers of next-generation power converters can now be able to quickly  utilize the WBG-DPT solution to optimize their designs. With the ability to run  on Tektronix 4, 5 and 6 Series MSO  oscilloscopes, integrating seamlessly into the measurement system of the  oscilloscopes, the WBG-DPT solution is claimed to have several industry-first  measurement capabilities, such as an automatic WBG de-skew technique, and  reverse recovery timing plots,  making it easier for engineers to see reverse recovery  details for multiple pulses overlaid on a single display. Measurements are also  designed to align with JEDEC and IEC standards for double pulse testing and diode reverse recovery. “Tektronix customers are the designers of the next generation of  cutting-edge power electronics technology, and their designs must be optimized  to balance efficiency, size and reliability,” says Daryl Ellis, mainstream portfolio general manager. “The design of the Tektronix WBG-DPT solution will  allow for simplified debugging, repeatable measurements (per JEDEC and IEC  standards) and a faster learning curve.  Test automation reduces test times  and re-testing errors, ensuring our customers meet their project timelines and  time-to-market plans,” he adds.
