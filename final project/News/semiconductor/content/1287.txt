South Wales Compound Semiconductor Cluster CSconnected forge links with SMARTNano Northern Ireland During a recent review meeting of the South Wales Compound Semiconductor Cluster  project CSconnected hosted by professor Paul Meredith at the new £50m Centre  for Integrated Semiconductor Materials (CISM)  at Swansea University, CSconnected hosted a visit by Mark Gubbins (director of  development at Seagate Technology) —representing the SMARTNano Northern Ireland  (NI) Cluster — as well as the Strength in Places Fund Programme Team.  “Collectively,  CSconnected and SMARTNano NI represents 4000–5000 high-value-add  manufacturing jobs which deliver a significant contribution to the UK economy,  and both Clusters are globally recognized for delivering cutting-edge research,  innovation and manufacturing,” says CSconnected chair Dr Wyn Meredith. “This is the first step  in forging closer links between the Northern Ireland and South Wales in the area of  advanced semiconductors, nanomaterials and associated manufacturing processes,”  he adds. Administered by the UK Research and  Innovation (UKRI), the £316m  Strength in Places Fund helps areas of the UK to build on existing  strengths in research and innovation to deliver benefits for their local  economy. Projects focus on a self-defined area anywhere in the UK, not limited  by nations or regions, with a defined critical mass of expertise, infrastructure  and capability. “UKRI has made an  investment of >£65m to accelerate economic growth in these Clusters and we  have a lot to learn from each other in complimentary areas of research, skills  development and manufacturing scale up,”  says SMARTNano NI’s Dr Mark Gubbins. “We are particularly  keen to act as a single voice to UK government to stress the importance of  supporting compound semiconductors and associated nanomaterials in the  recently announced UK Semiconductor strategy.”
