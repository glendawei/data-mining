Emcore doubles revenue projection for last-time buys of Broadband products to $20m Emcore Corp of Alhambra, CA, USA — the  world’s largest independent provider of inertial navigation products to the  aerospace & defense industry, with AS9100 aerospace-quality-certified  manufacturing facilities in Budd Lake, NJ and Concord, CA — expects revenue from last-time buys of Broadband products to be about  $20m, up from the $10m previously projected. The firm expects margins to be  consistent with the historical margin performance for these products. “In our fiscal second-quarter 2023 earnings release, we indicated  that last-time buys for products in  our broadband business would total approximately $10m. As of today, our  Broadband backlog stands near $20m, with some opportunity for additional  upside,” says president & CEO Jeffrey Rittichier. “Shipments of these  products are being scheduled and are expected to largely be complete by the end  of the calendar year 2023.” Emcore expects indium phosphide  (InP) wafer production supporting Broadband products to conclude by the end of  July, and the majority of InP wafer operations to finish by the end of August. Electronics manufacturing services (EMS)  assembly for Broadband products is expected to be complete by around the end of  calendar year 2023. During this period, Emcore expects  to complete its planned headcount reduction of about 100 employees (primarily in Alhambra and China) as Broadband  operations wind down. Emcore is consolidating  facility space by downsizing the space being occupied at the Alhambra campus  from five to two buildings, relocating personnel in Concord, to the operations  area from the adjacent office building, and closing the manufacturing support  and engineering center in China. The firm expects restructuring actions to be  substantially completed by end-September.
