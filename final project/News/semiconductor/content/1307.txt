CGD introduces Application Interface Boards for trying out ICeGaN HEMTs in existing designs without PCB re-layout Cambridge GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) — which was  spun out of the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Electrical  Power and Energy Conversion group in 2016 and designs, develops and  commercializes power transistors and ICs that use GaN-on-silicon  substrates — has introduced a  range of Application Interface Boards that allow designers to try out its  ICeGaN high-electron-mobility transistors  (HEMTs) in existing circuits in place of competing MOSFET or GaN devices  without having to re-layout the PCB. Application Interface Boards are adaptor PCBs that are soldered to  an ICeGaN device, which map each pin/signal from the ICeGaN HEMT footprint to  the corresponding pins/signals of an alternative component footprint.  “These Application Interface Boards are designed for design and  evaluation purposes only, of course. This is a quick, first step to enable the  user to put one of our ICeGaN ICs into an existing design,” says Peter  Comiskey, director of application engineering. “There is some minor impact on  thermal performance, but surprisingly little difference in EMC or electrical  performance.” CGD offers Application Interface Boards for a number of  industry-standard devices from leading MOSFET and GaN device makers. A full  list can be found on the user guide, but the firm  can also develop an Application Interface Board for devices not currently  supported for delivery within four weeks.
