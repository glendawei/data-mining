Transphorm wins $15m contract from US National Security Technology Accelerator Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near  Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and  AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors  (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion — has been awarded a contract for up to $15m from the  National Security Technology  Accelerator (NSTXL). The contract is for the project ECLIPSE (‘Technology for Nitrogen-Polar Gallium Nitride:  Epiwafers & Substrates’), under which Transphorm is commissioned to  manufacture GaN epitaxial wafers. The contract proposal process was  administered by the Strategic & Spectrum  Missions Advanced Resilient Trusted System (S2MARTS)  as an OTA (Other Transaction  Agreement), managed by NSTXL. Transphorm says that its opportunity to contribute to this project  underscores its IP, knowledge and expertise in the GaN materials sector as well  as its metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) manufacturing infrastructure. Transphorm’s experience in GaN epiwafer design, development and  production of high-voltage GaN platforms spans more than ten years. These initiatives constitute  multiple verticals for its Power and RF GaN businesses. “The value of and potential for advanced GaN materials is clear in  a wide range of applications. We’ve developed multiple high-power-density  platforms that generate record performance and efficiency advantages suited for  power conversion and RF  applications,” says chief technology officer  & co-founder Umesh Mishra. “This type of innovation is where Transphorm  excels because of its strong core epi materials versatility coupled with its  device and manufacturing capabilities,” he adds. “We’ve worked to evolve and  better all GaN technology aspects —materials, design, and process. We now look  forward to strong execution on the ECLIPSE program, enhancing our capability to  supply advanced GaN epiwafers.”
