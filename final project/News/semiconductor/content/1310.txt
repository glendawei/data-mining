Mojo Vision develops first 300mm GaN-on-Si blue LED wafer for micro-LED display Mojo Vision Inc of Saratoga, CA, USA — which is developing and  commercializing micro-LED display technology for consumer, enterprise and  government applications — has announced a development and process milestone  with the light-up of what it claims is the first 300mm GaN-on-silicon blue micro-LED array  wafer, marking progress towards maturing micro-LED manufacturing at 300mm CMOS  fabs. This is Mojo Vision’s fourth record in the past five years  for the display industry, after setting records for the smallest, densest  dynamic display including 14k pixels per inch (PPI), 20k PPI  and 28k PPI. Micro-LEDs provide critical performance, efficiency and  form-factor advantages essential to applications in extended reality (XR),  wearables, automotive, consumer electronics, and high-speed  communications. Mojo Vision says that it overcame extensive supply chain  and wafer qualification issues, such as wafer bow and contamination concerns,  to get GaN-on-silicon wafers allowed into the 300mm facility. “At Mojo Vision we are focused on disrupting the existing display  ecosystem, paving the way for scalability of the technology, and driving  broader adoption in consumer and enterprise markets,” says CEO Dr Nikhil  Balram. “Achieving cost-effective, large-scale manufacturing is the gap we are  working to bridge with this breakthrough,” he adds. “Mojo Vision’s advancements establish a roadmap for commercial  scaling of micro-LED technology using processes compatible with  industry-standard 300mm fabs,” comments Dr Rajeeva Lahri, advisory board  member, who has over 40 years of experience in operations, R&D and  business management in the semiconductor industry, including senior leadership  roles at Globalfoundries, Freescale Semiconductor, National Semiconductor and  Intersil. Mojo Vision has received over $22.4m in new Series A funding  at initial close, accelerating the development and commercialization of what it  claims is the world’s smallest, densest micro-LED display technology for  consumer, enterprise and government applications.
