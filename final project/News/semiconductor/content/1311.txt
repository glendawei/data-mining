IQE launches 200mm RGB epi for micro-LED display qualification Epiwafer and substrate maker IQE plc of  Cardiff, Wales, UK has launched a new portfolio of 200mm (8”)  red, green and blue (RGB) epitaxial wafer products for micro-LED display  qualification. Micro-LEDs based on gallium nitride  (GaN) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) provide new display technology that is  being designed into multiple new platforms such as wearables, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR)  headsets and large-format displays, says the firm. IQE  claims that its GaN and GaAs epitaxy is critical in enabling faster adoption of  micro-LEDs because its technology, high-volume manufacturing platforms and  resulting scale provide customers with a commercial advantage.

With multi-wavelength solutions available at  wafer diameters including new options at 200mm (8”), IQE is delivering  qualified foundry capacity from its multi-continent operations, which it claims  is a significant point of difference as it provides customers with epitaxy  supply chain  diversification. 
  Also, by scaling the technology  roadmap from 200mm (8”) to 300mm (12”), IQE aims to provide a cost-effective  solution. “We are pleased to offer our customers the industry’s broadest range of  materials technology platforms for micro-LED display qualification,” claims Dr Mark J. Furlong, executive VP of business development. “IQE can play a critical role in accelerating the  deployment of micro-LEDs across many end-applications, and the launch of this  new portfolio is in line with our strategy to diversify into GaN technologies,  in the high-growth display market.”
