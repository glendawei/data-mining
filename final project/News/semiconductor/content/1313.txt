Navitas to be added to Russell 3000 Index Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide  (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA is to be added as a member of the  broad-market Russell 3000 Index (effective  after the US market opens on 26 June) as part of the 2023 Russell indexes reconstitution. Annual reconstitution of the Russell indexes captures the largest  US stocks as of 28 April, ranking them by total market capitalization.  Membership in the Russell 3000 Index, which remains in place for one  year, means automatic inclusion in the large-cap Russell 1000 Index  or small-cap Russell 2000 Index as well as the appropriate growth and  value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for its Russell  indexes primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings and style  attributes. Founded in 2014, Navitas introduced what it claimed to be the  first commercial GaN power integrated circuits. Entering mass production in  2018, its proprietary GaNFast power ICs integrate GaN power and drive with  control, sensing and protection circuits to enable faster charging, higher  power density and greater energy savings. Complementary GeneSiC power devices  are optimized high-power, high-voltage and high-reliability silicon carbide SiC  solutions. Focus markets include mobile, consumer, data center, electric vehicle  (EV), solar, wind, smart grid and  industrial. Over 185 Navitas patents are issued or pending. Over 75 million  GaN and 10 million SiC units have been shipped, and Navitas introduced the  industryâ€™s only 20-year GaNFast warranty. The firm was also the first  semiconductor company to be CarbonNeutral-certified.
