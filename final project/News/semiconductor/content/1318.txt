Seoul Semi gains permanent injunction in Europe against infringing LED products South Korean LED maker Seoul  Semiconductor Co Ltd  says that the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf, Germany, has issued a final  judgement confirming a permanent injunction for infringement of its patent  against multiple LED companies’ LEDs. The judgement extends to LED products from Everlight Electronics Co Ltd,  which were distributed globally through Mouser Electronics Inc, as well as LED products from LED Engin merged into Osram GmbH. The German Supreme Court also  confirmed the validity of Seoul’s patent in July 2022 by dismissing a patent  invalidation lawsuit brought by the accused infringer. Starting in June, the Unitary Patents system will be implemented  in Europe. Under this new system, patent infringement judgements from the  Unified Patent Court will  simultaneously take effect in 17 European countries, including Germany, France  and Italy. As a result, the deterrent effect of patent infringement judgements  has significantly increased, contributing to establishing a culture that  respects intellectual property  rights, says Seoul Semi. Seoul and its affiliates have hence obtained 14 permanent  injunction judgements against manufacturers and distributors of infringing  products in the USA and Europe over the past five years.  These judgements also include permanent injunctions, an order of recall and  destruction against filament LED bulbs manufactured by a Phillips brand  affiliate. “While emphasizing ESG management, some large LED companies are  merely buying and distributing infringing products under their brands in the  market without manufacturing activities,” says Seoul Semi’s CEO Myeng-Ki Hong.  “Also, some global finished goods companies continue to purchase and use these  infringing products, despite being aware of the infringement,” he adds. “Seoul  will continue to take necessary measures against infringing companies.”
