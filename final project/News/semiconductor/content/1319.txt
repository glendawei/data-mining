All-MOCVD 980nm laser on (001) silicon Hong Kong University of Science and  Technology and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have reported continuous wave (CW) 980nm laser operation from structures grown on silicon  (Si) by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition  (MOCVD) [Qi Lin et al, Optics Express, v31, p15326, 2023].  The team used indium gallium arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP) layers for the quantum wells (QWs), and aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) for the barriers and cladding. The researchers see the 980nm wavelength as  having potential for optical fiber communication  and internet protocol network systems. In particular,  980nm light can be used to pump erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). The laser structure (Figure 1) was grown on (001) silicon, as used in mainstream complementary  metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics manufacturing. The epitaxial growth  was through MOCVD in two reaction chambers for the GaAs template and for the  laser structure.
