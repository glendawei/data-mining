NUBURU delivers first blue-laser-powered area 3D printer light engine NUBURU Inc of Centennial, CO, USA — which conducts research,  development, design and manufacturing of high-power, high-brightness industrial  blue lasers — says that  in first-quarter 2023 it delivered what it claims is the world’s first  blue-laser-powered area 3D printer  light engine to its technical  partner under a contract with the US Air Force. The goal of  this Direct to Phase II contract is  to use the absorption advantages of the blue laser and combine it with the  ability to project an image onto the powder bed using a Texas Instruments Digital Light Projector to dramatically increase the  speed of 3D printing of metal parts.  NUBURU delivered the light engine to  its partner to integrate it into a 3D printer.
