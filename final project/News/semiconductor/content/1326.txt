Aixtron introducing new Executive Committee to support CEO and CFO In October, deposition equipment maker Aixtron SE of  Herzogenrath, near Aachen, Germany will introduce a new Executive Committee to  support chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Felix Grawert and  chief financial officer Dr Christian Danninger. Due to personal reasons,  current chief operating officer Dr Jochen Linck will not renew his contract,  which ends in September. “During his time at Aixtron, Dr Jochen Linck, together with  his team, has realized key initiatives like the launch of the G10 family  enabling further growth. As a result, Aixtron is  well positioned and prepared for the future,” comments Kim Schindelhauer, chairman  of the Supervisory Board. The future Executive Committee will  consist of the Executive Board and selected executives of Aixtron’s leadership team. The Committee will  support the CEO and CFO in strategic and operational matters and will have  decision-making power. This means that, for decisions, the company will draw  even more on the experience of its leadership team, which it reckons will be of  great advantage in a dynamic environment like the semiconductor industry. “With this setup, Aixtron is well positioned for the further positive development  and growth in the years to come,” believes Grawert. As of October, the Executive Board will  thus consist of CEO Grawert and CFO Danninger. No new Executive Board member  will be appointed to succeed Linck. Instead, the new position of senior VP operations  will be created, who will be a member of the Executive Committee.
