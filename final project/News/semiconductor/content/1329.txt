TRUMPF expanding laser production site in Ulm TRUMPF Photonic Components GmbH of Ulm,  Germany (part of the TRUMPF Group) has been highlighted by Apple as a key supplier for its work  supporting the proximity sensor in iPhone, which turns off the screen when it  detects an object that is close by (e.g. when  a user holds iPhone up to their ear), saving power and preventing inadvertent  touches. “We have already shipped over 1 billion  of our vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers  (VCSELs) to Apple,” notes CEO Berthold Schmidt.
