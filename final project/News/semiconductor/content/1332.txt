Navitas doubles Q1 revenue year-on-year, boosted by acquisitions For first-quarter 2023, gallium nitride  (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas  Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA has reported revenue of $13.46m, up  8% on $12.3m last quarter and almost  doubling from $6.74m a year ago. This takes into  account revenue from silicon carbide power semiconductor device  designer and manufacturer GeneSiC Semiconductor Inc of Dulles, VA, USA  (acquired in mid-August 2022). “I am very pleased with our progress in the quarter across  acquisitions, product launches, customer developments and market expansion,”  says CEO & co-founder Gene Sheridan. “A comprehensive portfolio of  leading-edge GaN, SiC, digital isolators and low-voltage silicon system-control  ICs is translating into significant customer value, market adoption and  financial results.” Product highlights  are listed as follows: On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin has risen from 40.6% last  quarter to 41.1% in Q1/2023, although this is down on 44% a year ago. Operating expenses have grown further, from  $12.5m a year ago and $17m last quarter to $17.8m. Net loss has risen further, from $9.65m last quarter to $10.9m. During the quarter,  cash and cash equivalents have hence fallen from $110.3m to $100.8m. Navitas cites a customer pipeline of $760m. Specific market highlights in Q1/2023 are  listed as: Navitas expects revenue to grow to $16–17m  in second-quarter 2023 and to double for full-year 2023. Gross margin should  rise by 25–50 basis points in Q2,  and grow incrementally throughout the year, exiting 2023 in the mid-40s percent  range. Operating expenses are expected to rise to about $19m in Q2 then grow in  the mid-high single digits on a  quarterly basis throughout the year, albeit declining as a percentage of  revenue as the business scales.
