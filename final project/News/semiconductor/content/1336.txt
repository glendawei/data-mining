Orbray and MIRISE collaborating on vertical diamond power devices for EVs Tokyo-based Orbray Co Ltd (which makes precision jewel parts, DC  coreless motors, fiber-optic components, and medical devices) and automotive  semiconductor research company MIRISE Technologies Corp of Minamiyama, Aichi Prefecture, Japan (a joint venture  founded in April 2020 by DENSO and Toyota) have begun collaborating on  vertical diamond power devices. Over the three-year period of  the project, Orbray and MIRISE aim to use their respective technologies,  resources and expertise in diamond substrates and power devices to develop the  technologies needed to deploy vertical diamond power devices in a wide range of  electric vehicles  in the future. In the research collaboration,  Orbray will be responsible for developing a p-type conductive diamond  substrate, while MIRISE will take charge of developing a high-voltage-operating  device structure  to demonstrate the feasibility of a vertical diamond power device. At the end of the  project, the firms plan to discuss the next stage of collaboration, such as  further R&D. Compared with existing  mainstream semiconductor materials such as silicon, silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), diamond is  considered to be the ultimate semiconductor material because it has  higher-voltage operating capability and superior thermal conductivity (heat  dissipation). In the future, the development and mass production of  next-generation automotive semiconductors using diamond is expected to improve  the fuel efficiency and power consumption  of electric vehicles,  and to reduce battery costs.
