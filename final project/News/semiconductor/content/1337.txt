Skyworks maintains strong cash flow generation For fiscal second-quarter  2023 (to end-March), Skyworks Solutions Inc of Irvine, CA, USA (which manufactures analog and  mixed-signal semiconductors) has reported revenue of $1153.1m, down 13.2% on  $1329m last quarter and 13.7% on $1335.6m a year ago. Skyworks’ largest customer comprised about 64% of  total revenue (down from 68% last quarter). Mobile  products comprised about 60% of total revenue (down from 65% last quarter). Mobile revenue from Skyworks’ largest customer grew year-on-year,  reflecting content gains across their product portfolio. However, this was  offset by weakness in demand from the Android smartphone ecosystem as it  continues to destock inventory. Broad  Markets products reached 40% of total revenue for the first time, with a strong  contribution from automotive, infrastructure and industrial markets. On a non-GAAP basis, gross  margin was 50%, down from 51.5% last quarter (and at the bottom end of the 50–50.5% guidance range)  due to the inventory destocking leading to factory under-utilization charges. Operating  expenses were $190m (16.5% of revenue), cut from $193m last quarter, given the focus  on managing discretionary expense. Net income has fallen further, from $432.3m ($2.63 per  diluted share) a year ago and $415m  ($2.59 per diluted share) last quarter to $323.1m ($2.02 per diluted  share). “Despite a challenging  macro backdrop, the fundamentals of our business remained strong in the second  quarter with solid profitability and robust cash generation,” says chairman,  CEO & president Liam K. Griffin. Operating cash flow  was $411.7m. Capital expenditure has  been cut further, from $126.7m  a year ago and $64m last quarter to  just $45.3m. Free cash flow was hence $366m (cash  flow margin of 32% of revenue). Through fiscal first-half 2023, Skyworks has now  generated record free cash flow of $1.1bn (exceeding  the whole of fiscal 2022), representing free cash flow margin of 43%. During  the quarter, Skyworks paid $98.7m in dividends, repurchased $9.1m of stock, and  repaid $200m of variable-rate term loans. Overall,  cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities hence rose from $992.6m to $1061.4m, providing  sufficient liquidity to repay $500m of bonds that will reach maturity during  fiscal Q3/2023. Also, following  quarter-end, Skyworks’ board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.62 per share of common stock (payable on 20 June, to stockholders  of record at the close of business on 30 May). “We are driving  operational efficiency while leveraging our leading-edge technologies and  world-class manufacturing capabilities to capture new opportunities across an  expanding set of customers,” says Griffin. “We expanded our design-win pipeline,  reflecting our success in diversifying our customer base and product  portfolio.” Across  mobile and IoT applications, Skyworks: Across  infrastructure and industrial applications, Skyworks: In  automotive applications, Skyworks: Taking into account the ongoing challenging macroeconomic  environment and a slower-than-expected recovery and inventory destocking  (especially in the Android ecosystem), for fiscal third-quarter 2023 (to  end-June) Skyworks expects revenue to  fall to $1.05–1.09bn, with Broad Markets revenue down slightly. “Initially, we were anticipating a stronger second half of the  fiscal year and calendar year… We do see some signs of recovery, although I  would say later and slower than initially anticipated,” notes senior VP  & chief financial officer Kris Sennesael. “As a result of that, we are  adjusting our factory utilizations across all our factories. We have been  operating our business at a slightly elevated level of inventory [$1257m, up  from $928m a year ago], in anticipation of a stronger recovery in the back  half. Now that the recovery is going to be slower than expected, we are also  going to adjust our internal inventory levels and right-size that.” While the firm is reducing its internal inventory levels, fiscal  Q3 gross margin should be 47–48%, reflecting a 400–500  basis-point impact from factory under-utilization charges, partially offset by  ongoing cost reductions and operational efficiencies that should cut operating  expenses to $183–187m. Diluted earnings per share is  expected to fall to $1.67. “Given our consistent level of profitability and lower CapEx  spending, we expect free cash flow margin to remain well above our target of  30% for the fiscal year,” says Sennesael.
