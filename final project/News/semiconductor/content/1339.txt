Qorvo quarterly revenue down 45.7% year-on-year while channel inventory consumed Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA  (which provides core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure  and defense applications) has reported revenue for the fiscal full-year (to  1 April) down by 23.2% from 2022’s $4646m to 2023’s $3569m. The two 10%  customers were Apple (at 37%, up from 33%  in fiscal 2022) and Samsung (at 12%, up slightly from 11%). Fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 revenue was $632.7m, down 14.9% on $743.3m last quarter and 45.7% on $1166.2m a  year ago. However, this outperformed the midpoint of the $600–640m guidance range, despite a weak demand  environment and despite Qorvo reducing channel inventory of its components in  the Android ecosystem by about 25% (following  a more than 20% reduction in the December quarter). Advanced Cellular Group (ACG) revenue was hence $418m (down 14.9% on $491m last quarter  and 46.2% on $777m a year ago). However, total Android revenue was up  sequentially on the strength of a large customer flagship ramp with record  Qorvo content. “March was a low point for China-based Android quarterly  revenue,” believes president & CEO Bob Bruggeworth. High-Performance Analog (HPA) revenue was $133m (down  14.2% on $155m last quarter and 37% on $211m a year ago). Relative  strength in power devices and defense markets was offset by weakness in consumer-facing  power management markets and inventory digestion at infrastructure OEMs. Connectivity & Sensors Group (CSG) revenue was $82m (down  15.5% on $97m last quarter and 54% on $179m a year ago). Relative stability in automotive was offset  by continued inventory draw-downs and weak end-market demand for Wi-Fi-enabled  products and cellular IoT. “We held factory production at characteristically low volumes,  which created under-utilization impacts that negatively affected margins,” says  chief  financial officer Grant Brown. “Charges related to low factory  utilization continued to weigh on margins on a year-over-year basis.” Impacted by about 1000 basis points due to lower factory utilization and 80-100  basis points due to inflation across  direct costs, non-GAAP gross margin has hence fallen  from 52% a year ago to 41.3%. Nevertheless, this was up slightly from 40.9%  last quarter after a modest increase in factory utilization. Full-year gross margin  has fallen from 52.4% for 2022 to 46.3% for 2023. Operating expenses were $227.4m, up from $205.7m last quarter, given  the timing of seasonal employee-related expenses such as payroll taxes, the  timing of vacation accruals and other items driven principally by R&D as  Qorvo supports its customers and invests in future growth opportunities. Net income has fallen further, from $339.6m ($3.12 per diluted share) a year ago and $76.5m ($0.75 per diluted share) last quarter to $25.7m ($0.26 per diluted share, but above the forecasted $0.10–0.15). Operating cash flow has fallen to $65.4m. Capital  expenditure was steady at $34.1m. Free cash flow hence fell to $31.3m. During the quarter, Qorvo  repurchased $150m worth of shares. Overall, cash and equivalents therefore fell  from $919m to $810m. Qorvo has about $2bn  of debt outstanding with no near-term maturities. “We are seeing increasing strength in customer design activity across  our businesses, and we expect improved financial performance supported by  content gains in large customer programs,” says Bruggeworth. Strategic highlights of the quarter are listed  as follows: “Despite ongoing weakness in end-markets, our strong design-win activity  on large customer programs supports our view for sequential revenue growth in  June and robust sequential revenue growth in September,” says Brown. “We  anticipate continued progress reducing Android channel inventory in the coming  quarters, with a return to historical norms by calendar year-end.” Qorvo hence expects  total Android revenue to grow sequentially in June. For fiscal first-quarter 2024 (to end-June 2023), Qorvo expects  revenue of $620–660m, gross margin  of 41.5%, and diluted earnings per share of $0.15. Operating expenses should be up about $10m  sequentially due to investments in multi-year customer programs, investments in  core systems and other productivity initiatives, and the return of incentive  compensation based on expectations for improved financial performance. “Inventory  balance will increase in the June quarter as we support a seasonal ramp at our  largest customer,” says Brown. “Our expectations  for this quarter are for channel inventories to decline again in the double  digits. Later this calendar year, we expect Android channel inventories will  normalize. Outside of the Android ecosystem, there are smaller pockets of  channel inventory elsewhere in our business that may take longer to digest.” For  fiscal Q2/2024 (to end-September 2023), Qorvo  expects revenue to grow about 50% sequentially, driven by strong content gains  and a large seasonal ramp. Gross margin  should also rise by about 400 basis points  as product mix begins to favor some newer  products for Qorvo’s largest customers that are less burdened by higher unit costs associated with under-utilization. In  fiscal Q3/2024 (to end-December 2023), revenue is expected to be roughly flat  sequentially. Gross margin should fall by 100–150 basis points  as utilization begins to ramp down following that large seasonal ramp and product mix begins to modestly shift to some of that  higher-cost inventory. “In  the March [2005] quarter, our fiscal Q4/2024, we expect Android to be a higher  percent of our mix, but decline less than might be historic seasonality due to  a clean channel and returning to shipping to end-demand,” says Brown.  However, gross margin will be down by 200–300 basis points  quarter-on-quarter as mix reflects that higher-cost inventory. For  full-year fiscal 2024, Qorvo expects revenue to be up on fiscal 2023 and to  benefit from strong dollar content growth  at its largest customers. Gross margin  should be about 44% (down from fiscal 2023’s 46.3%).  “Although there is no change to our view of returning to 50% in the gross margin line, it’s unlikely in 2024… It’s  dominated by under-utilization,” concludes Brown.
