Record sub-micron LED red emission efficiency University of Michigan in the USA claims  record efficiencies from red-emitting sub-micrometer light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [Ayush Pandey et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v122, p151103, 2023].  Some of the intellectual property arising  from the work has been licensed to NS Nanotech Inc, co-founded by one  of the paperâ€™s authors, Zetian Mi. The company has  in return funded some of the research. Micron-scale LEDs are of particular  interest for more efficient and versatile display technologies. The red sector  of the visible part of the spectrum has been a particular roadblock, with conventional  devices suffering poor performance in micron-scale form factors. Although millimeter-scale III-nitride LEDs  based on indium gallium nitride (InGaN) LEDs have very poor performance for red emission,  the impact of scaling to the micron-scale is less marked, and in some respects  offers enhanced operation compared with conventional devices.
