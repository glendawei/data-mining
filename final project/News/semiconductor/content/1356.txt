ROHM begins mass production of 650V GaN HEMTs Japan-based power semiconductor maker ROHM Co Ltd has  begun mass production of the 650V gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility  transistors (HEMTs) GNP1070TC-Z and GNP1150TCA-Z, which are optimized for a  wide range of power supply systems in industrial equipment and consumer devices,  including servers and AC adapters. The new products  are jointly developed with Ancora Semiconductors Inc (an affiliate of global  power and thermal management solutions provider Delta Electronics Inc),  which was established in July 2022 to develop GaN devices and technology.  After initiating  mass production of 150V GaN HEMTs (with a gate breakdown voltage  of 8V) in 2022, in March ROHM established control IC technology for  maximizing GaN performance. Now, ROHM has developed 650V GaN HEMTs with  performance that contributes to higher efficiency and smaller size in a wider  range of power supply systems.
