Transphorm releases simulation model of first 1200V GaN-on-sapphire device Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near Santa Barbara,  CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion — has announced the availability of  its 1200V FET simulation model and  preliminary datasheet. The normally-off TP120H070WS FET is claimed to be the  only 1200V GaN-on-sapphire power semiconductor introduced to date, making  its model the first of its kind. Key preliminary  device model specifications for the TP120H070WS include: Transphorm says that the simulation  model’s release indicates the firm’s ability to support future  automotive power systems as well as three-phase power systems  typically used in the broad industrial, datacom, and renewables markets. These  applications can benefit from the 1200V GaN device’s higher power density  and reliability along with equal or better performance at more reasonable cost points  versus alternative technologies, says the firm. Transphorm recently validated the GaN device’s higher performance  ability in a 5kW 900V buck converter switching at 100kHz. The 1200V GaN  device achieved 98.7% efficiency, exceeding that of a similarly rated  production silicon carbide (SiC)  MOSFET. The Verilog-A device model is recommended for use with the  SIMetrix Pro v8.5 Circuit Simulator. A LTSpice model is in  development and will be released in fourth-quarter 2023. Simulation modeling  allows for fast and efficient power system design validation while reducing  design iterations, development time, and hardware investments. While the 1200V GaN device is an optimal solution for various  market applications, it offers an advantage especially for automotive systems,  says Transphorm. The electric vehicle industry, especially at the  higher-kilowatt nodes for larger vehicles, is moving toward 800V batteries in  the latter half of this decade. As such, 1200V power conversion switches  will be used to deliver the required performance level. Transphorm reckons that  its 1200V platform is therefore well positioned for next-generation onboard charger,  DC-to-DC converters, drive inverters, and pole charging systems. “We’re proving that GaN can very easily play in application  markets previously slated for silicon carbide, which opens a wide range of  market adoption potential for our business and GaN in general,” says chief  technology officer & co-founder Umesh Mishra. The 1200V device is being exhibited in booth 108 (Hall 7) at the  Power, Control and Intelligent Motion (PCIM) Europe 2023 trade show  in Nuremberg, Germany (9–11 May).  1200V FET samples are expected to be available by first-quarter 2024. For current-model EVs using 400V batteries, Transphorm offers 650V  normally-off SuperGaN FETs that are AEC-Q101 qualified to 175°C and in volume  production.
