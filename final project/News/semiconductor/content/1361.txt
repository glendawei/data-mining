Infineon launches CoolGaN 600V GIT HEMT portfolio Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany says  that it has integrated the  CoolGaN 600V hybrid-drain-embedded gate injection transistor (HDâ€“GIT)  technology into its in-house manufacturing. The firm is now releasing the  complete portfolio of its GaN devices to the broader market. Infineon says that, taking advantage of its fully owned and  controlled supply chain, the expanded GaN portfolio includes a wide range  of discrete and fully integrated GaN devices that far exceed JEDEC lifetime  requirements. The new CoolGaN devices have been optimized for applications  ranging from industrial switched-mode  power supplies (SMPS) for servers,  telecom and solar to consumer applications, such  as chargers and adapters, motor drives, TV/monitor,  and LED lighting systems.
