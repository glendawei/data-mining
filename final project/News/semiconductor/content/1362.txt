PARALIA to develop LiDAR/radar optical multi-beam beam-forming platform based on multi-port linear optical operator architectures using InP and SiN integration PARALIA (Photonic Multi-beam Beamforming Technology  enabling RADAR/LiDAR Multisensor Fusion platforms for Aerospace and Automated  Driving applications) is a new EU HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions Project launched on  1 January that aims to  develop fundamental innovations in automotive and aerospace applications.  Funded under the HORIZON-CL4-2022-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-03 Call (project  number 101093013), PARALIA is coordinated by Greeceâ€™s Aristotle University of Thessaloniki  and runs from January 2023 through to June 2026. The milestones achieved in the on-going  global race for highly automated or autonomous vehicles are setting the stage  for major transformations across the transportation industry, led primary by  the expected wide adoption of Level 2 and Level 3 automated driving  systems in next-generation automotive vehicles, the forward-looking roadmaps of  major technology vendors, predicting next-generation consumer-centric fleets of  robo-taxis and the growing maturity and expected proliferation of autonomous or  Enchanted Flight Vision System (EFVS)-augmented Urban Air Mobility.  However, transforming these technological concepts into tangible reality has  been proving challenging, with recent studies urgently calling for a new  generation of integrated, cost-effective and multi-domain sensory systems,  capable of providing machine learning (ML) algorithms with the required  heterogenous environmental information in a low-energy envelope. PARALIA aims  to demonstrate breakthrough performance by enabling an agile, low-cost and  energy-efficient multi-sensor that combines radar and light detection &  ranging (LiDAR) technologies and by re-architecting the sensors ecosystem,  enabling ultra-high resolution at ultra-long distances, which is crucial for existing  and future automotive and aerospace applications. PARALIA aims  to develop a powerful common LiDAR/radar optical multi-beam beam-forming  platform based on best-in-class multi-port linear optical operator  architectures exploiting the synergy of indium phosphide (InP) and silicon nitride  (SiN) integration platforms. The consortium brings together six leading  industrial partners, and three academic and research institutes in the photonic  integrated circuit (PIC) and photonic system value chain. Project  participants are the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece), Institute  of Communication and Computer Systems (Greece), Argotech a.s (Czech  Republic), Collins Aerospace Ireland (Ireland), LioniX International BV  (Netherlands), SIKLU Communication Ltd (Israel), Sivers Semiconductors  (Sweden), VALEO Autoklimatizace K.S. (Czech Republic) and Fraunhofer  Heinrich Hertz Institute (Germany).
