Thick single quantum well InGaN LEDs with high external quantum efficiency and low droop University of California Santa Barbara in the USA and École Polytechnique in France  have reported improved external quantum efficiency (EQE) and reduced efficiency droop in c-plane  light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with thicker indium gallium nitride  (InGaN) single quantum wells (SQW) [Y. C. Chow  et al, J. Appl. Phys., v133, p143101, 2023]. The team used doped barriers to reduce the  internal electric field in the  well region. Such fields tend to separate holes and electrons, reducing  radiative recombination into photons. Instead, the energy of the injected  carriers is dissipated in non-radiative recombination processes: Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) through recombination center defects at low injection, and Auger  three-body interactions at high current and carrier density, creating (non-thermal) efficiency droop. A thick QW would allow reduced Auger  recombination for the same output — in theory. However, thin QWs are used for  to bring the electrons and holes closer together, increasing their chances of  recombining into photons. The electric fields arise from charge  polarization contrasts between the GaN and InGaN chemical bonds, resulting in  polarization charges at the GaN/InGaN interfaces. Doped barriers would  introduce a countervailing component to the electric field from the depletion  of the doped regions, leaving ionized impurities. Another approach is to begin  with non-polar or semi-polar substrates; however, these are much more expensive  than the sapphire typically used to grow c-plane GaN/InGaN. As usual, life is not straightforward. Doped  material tends to have higher SRH-inducing defect densities. Hence, the  research team performed a wide range of preparatory simulation and experimental  work to find the right balance of parameters. Key ones were the doping  concentration, and the separation of the doped regions from the quantum well.
