Reference design uses new Analog Devices controller optimized to drive EPC GaN FETs Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of  El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes enhancement-mode gallium nitride on  silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors (FETs) and  integrated circuits for power management applications – has announced  the availability of the  EPC9158, a dual-output synchronous buck converter  reference design board operating at  500kHz switching frequency that  converts an input voltage of 48–54V to a regulated 12V output and delivers  up to 25A per phase or 50A total continuous current. The combination of the new  LTC7890 synchronous GaN buck controller from  Analog Devices Inc of Wilmington, MA,  USA with GaN FETs from EPC enables a highly efficient solution in a  small footprint for high-power-density applications. The solution achieves  96.5% efficient at 48V to 12V and 50A continuous current. The high power density makes this solution suitable for computing,  industrial, consumer and telecom power systems  requiring small size and high efficiency. eGaN FETs provide the fast switching, high  efficiency and small size that can meet the stringent power density  requirements of these leading-edge applications, says EPC. The EPC9158 reference design uses the EPC2218 100V enhancement-mode GaN FET and the LTC7890  two-phase analog buck controller  with integrated GaN drivers.
