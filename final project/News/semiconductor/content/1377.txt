Infineon introduces HybridPACK Drive G2 automotive power module for EV traction inverters Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany has launched the HybridPACK Drive G2  automotive power module, which  builds on the HybridPACK Drive G1 concept of an integrated B6 package, offering scalability within the  same footprint and extending it to higher power and ease-of-use. The HybridPACK Drive G2  will be available with various current ratings,  voltage levels (750V and 1200V) and  Infineon’s next-generation chip technologies EDT3 (silicon IGBT) and CoolSiC G2 MOSFET.

With a power range of up to 300kW within the 750V and 1200V  classes, the HybridPACK Drive G2 is said to provide high ease-of-use  and new features, such as an integration option for a next-generation phase current sensor and on-chip temperature  sensing, which enable system cost  improvements. The power module  achieves higher performance and power density  through improved assembly and interconnect technology. The adoption of new  interconnect technology (chip sintering) and of new materials (new black plastic  housing) enables a higher temperature rating,  resulting in higher performance and longer product life. The first generation (G1) of HybridPACK Drive was introduced in  2017, using silicon EDT2 technology. It offers a power range of 100-180kW in  the 750V class. In 2021, Infineon expanded its product family with the first  generation of HybridPACK Drive  Automotive CoolSiC MOSFETs, which allowed the inverter design to achieve higher  power up to 250kW within the 1200V class, longer driving range, smaller battery size  and optimized system size and cost. With a track record of nearly 3 million units sold in various global  electric vehicle (EV) platforms, the  HybridPACK Drive is now Infineon’s  market-leading power module. The lead products (FS1150R08, FS01MR08, FS02MR12) of the new  HybridPACK Drive G2 are in production and will be  available from May, with additional product variants to follow in 2023 and  2024. The product is being showcased at the Power, Control and Intelligent Motion (PCIM) Europe 2023 trade fair  in Nuremberg, Germany (9–11 May); evalkits and design-in support  are available to enable fast and easy evaluation for customers.
