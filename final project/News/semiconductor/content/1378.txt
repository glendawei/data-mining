Riber’s Q1 revenue up 54% year-on-year For first-quarter 2023, Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which  manufactures molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation  sources – has  reported revenue of €3.7m, up 54% on €2.4m a year ago. MBE systems revenue was €1.9m (comprising billing for one research  system), compared with nil a year ago. Services & Accessories revenue has  fallen by 23% from €2.4m to €1.8m. Of total revenue, 15% came from Europe, 27%  in Asia, 6% in North America and 51% in other countries. The order book  totaled €33.1m at the end of March, up 45% from €22.8m at end-March 2022, driven by the increase in  industrial demand for both R&D and production. Specifically,  orders for MBE systems are up by 60% from €16.7m to €26.7m, comprising  11 machines (including  four production machines). This does not include the option to buy, announced  on 8 June  2022, for four production machines. The Services & Accessories order book  is up 5% from €6.2m to €6.5m. In view of the  strong order book (with a  high proportion of machines deliverable in 2023), Riber is targeting full-year  revenue of about €40m (up 44%  on 2022’s €27.8m). This  growth should be combined with an improvement in profitability. Riber expects  that, in a buoyant market context, it will continue taking orders during  second-quarter 2023.
