InAs quantum dot lasers butt-coupled to SOI waveguides Researchers based in China claim the first  demonstration of indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dot lasers epitaxially grown on trenched silicon-on-insulator (SOI)  templates with butt-coupled silicon (Si) waveguides (WGs). [Wen-Qi Wei et al. Light: Science & Applications, v12,  p84, 2023]. The team from Institute of Physics,  Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, comments: “Our results demonstrate  that monolithic integration of III-V laser with silicon photonic components will no longer  be a design-level hypothesis.” Efficient integration of a laser structure  with low-cost silicon photonics is highly desirable for a wide range of advanced  applications for on-chip optical interconnect and communications, along with  integrated optical ranging, for system deployment in artificial intelligence, hyper-scale data centers, high-performance computing, light-detection and  ranging (LIDAR) and microwave photonics.
