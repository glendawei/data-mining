Infineon and Schweizer extend cooperation in chip embedding to develop more efficient silicon carbide automotive solutions Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany and Schweizer Electronic AG of Schramberg, Germany are collaborating on ways to further increase the efficiency of  chips based on silicon carbide (SiC)  by developing a solution to embed Infineonâ€™s 1200V CoolSiC chips directly onto  printed circuit boards (PCB), which  will increase the range of electric vehicles  and reduce the total system costs.
