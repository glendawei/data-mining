BluGlass secures GaN laser purchase orders for testing in quantum sensing and surgical applications BluGlass Ltd of Silverwater, Australia  – which manufactures gallium nitride  (GaN) blue laser diodes based on its  proprietary low-temperature, low-hydrogen remote-plasma chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology – has  secured two new GaN laser purchase orders from a “quantum photonics  pioneer” and a “leading medical device manufacturer”. Orders span BluGlass’ 405nm, 420nm and 450nm GaN laser product  suite and include the first order of its early prototype higher-powered 405nm  3W multi-mode lasers in flexible form factors. “Our lasers will be used for testing in novel quantum sensing  and surgical applications,” says CEO Jim Haden. “Our single-mode lasers in  violet and blue wavelengths are increasingly sought after as they are  ideal for biomedical, robotics and quantum applications,” he adds. “We are also experiencing strong interest in our advanced roadmaps  and higher-powered lasers, securing the first order of 50 alpha 3W multi-mode  violet prototypes for deployment in medical applications,” Haden continues.  “Ongoing enhancements to our launched product offering are driving conversion  efficiency and reliability improvements. If our alpha lasers test well  then, once the company moves to volume production of more mature devices, these  customers have the potential to place large, recurring purchase orders for  high-volume applications.” BluGlass says that these initial orders are immaterial from a  revenue perspective. The firm has begun fulfilling customer orders and is in  advanced discussions with multiple potential customers across its key market  segments.
