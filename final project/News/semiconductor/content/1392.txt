GaN Systems showcasing innovations at PCIM Europe In booth 9-204 at  the Power, Control and Intelligent Motion (PCIM) Europe 2023  trade fair in Nuremberg, Germany (9–11 May), GaN Systems Inc  of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of gallium nitride-based  power switching semiconductors for power conversion and control  applications) is showcasing GaN solutions demonstrating advances in  power density and efficiency across  automotive and additional markets. At PCIM  Europe, GaN Systems is showcasing the new GaN-based 11kW/800V on-board charger (OBC) reference design. Using GaN  transistors in an 800V OBC targets EV automotive design. The new OBC design  includes the following key features: The OBC  combines a three-level flying capacitor topology for a bridgeless totem-pole  PFC structure and dual active bridge  in the AC/DC and DC/DC, respectively. The GaN transistors halves the transistor  voltage stress, allowing the 650V GaN to be used in this and other 800V  applications. At PCIM, GaN Systems is also  showcasing the following: CEO Jim Witham  is also participating on Bodo’s Power Systems’  panel — ‘Wide Bandgap Design with  GaN HEMT and Vertical GaN’ (1:05pm in Hall 7, booth 480).
