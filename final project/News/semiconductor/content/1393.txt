Mouser to distribute Navitas’ wide-bandgap semiconductors products globally Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and  silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance,  CA, USA has signed an  agreement with global semiconductor and  electronic component distributor Mouser Electronics Inc (a  Berkshire Hathaway company). The new worldwide agreement will see Mouser stock Navitas GaNFast  and GeneSiC wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor technologies. GaNFast power ICs integrate GaN power and drive, with  control, sensing and protection to enable faster charging,  higher power density and greater  energy savings. Complementary  GeneSiC power devices are optimized  high-power, high-voltage and high-reliability SiC solutions. Focus markets  include mobile, consumer, data center,  electric vehicle (EV), solar, wind,  smart grid, and industrial. “The pressure on designers and system architects to improve  application performance while minimizing size and driving down energy use is creating a rapidly growing global  demand for efficient and integrated WBG semiconductors,” says David Carroll,  senior VP worldwide sales at  Navitas. “Mouser’s global reach means this agreement will give electronic design engineers and buyers improved  access to the advanced Navitas technologies that are playing a key role in  addressing this demand and meeting the needs of a market that is potentially  worth $22bn a year,” he adds. “Mouser is pleased to add this strong industry leader to our line card, and to deliver these innovative  power devices to our customers,”  comments Kristin Schuetter, Mouser’s VP of supplier management. “Design  engineers now have easy access to Navitas’ advanced components, backed by  Mouser's unsurpassed customer service and best-in-class logistics.”
