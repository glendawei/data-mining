Hon Hai collaborates with Ennostar and Unikorn to develop 6500PPI micro-LED micro-display with blue light brightness of 200,000 nits In collaboration with fellow Taiwan-based firms  Ennostar and Unikorn Semiconductor Corp, at Touch Taiwan 2023 in Taipei (19–21 April), Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) announced the development of a new  0.12-inch micro-display with a pixel density exceeding 6500PPI and a blue light brightness of 200,000 nits, using micro-LED technology. The purpose of the collaboration is to  improve micro-LED efficiency by optimizing the structure of micro-LED chips and  adopting a new thin-film protection technology, reducing surface defects,  improving external quantum efficiency,  and increasing product reliability. Considering the high-brightness requirements  of augmented reality (AR) applications, Unikorn — which has experience in III-V semiconductor  manufacturing and advanced process technology — was responsible for optimizing the micro-LED chip efficiency in this  joint development to ensure a balance between brightness and chip power consumption during subsequent full-color  conversion. Hon Hai, on the  other hand, used its own developed  color conversion technology to  further achieve full-color display effect at 3600PPI. For general high-PPI full-color displays, the  small pixel pitch cannot provide enough quantum dot optical density, causing leakage of blue light  in high-brightness scenes, resulting in blue halo and color shift among pixels, notes Hon Hai. The firm says that its micro-LED  manufacturing technology, based on a semiconductor process, uses  high-efficiency quantum dot  color conversion and a  self-developed reflective inter-pixel light shield technology to provide sufficient optical density of quantum dots and prevent color shift among pixels, producing high-purity red and  green light for full-color display effect. Hon Hai collaborated with Ennostar  and Unikorn Semiconductor for blue micro-LED  process development and foundry services, and to enhance the development of a  high-efficiency blue light pixel  process with a pixel pitch of 4μm. The long-term goal is to invest resources in  applications with the growth potential to achieve differentiation and  technological innovation. The new product can be widely used in smart glasses  and AR/VR devices, and Hon Hai  targets collaboration and technological innovation to expand business  opportunities in the fields of virtual reality, augmented reality,  and other metaverse applications.
