Emcore restructuring to focus on aerospace & defense Emcore Corp of Alhambra, CA, USA — the world’s largest independent provider of  inertial navigation products to the aerospace & defense industry — has announced a restructuring program as the final  phase of Emcore’s transition to Aerospace  & Defense. The firm is AS9100 aerospace quality certified at its manufacturing  facilities in Budd Lake, NJ and Concord, CA. “After months of discussions with several interested parties to  divest non-strategic product lines, we will now shut down the Broadband  business segment (cable TV, wireless, sensing, and chips) and  discontinue our defense optoelectronics product lines. We will continue to  build QMEMS and lithium niobate chips, but will close down our indium phosphide  (InP) wafer fabrication facility in Alhambra,” says president & CEO Jeff  Rittichier. “These actions will eliminate product lines that are no longer  part of our future and enable Emcore to  focus entirely on scaling our inertial navigation business.” Designed to reduce annual costs and expenses by about $12m, the  restructuring program includes a reduction in the workforce of about 100 staff  primarily in Alhambra and China, as well as consolidating facility space by  downsizing the space being occupied at the Alhambra campus from five to two  buildings, relocating Concord personnel to the operations area from the  adjacent office building, and closing the manufacturing support and engineering  center in China. The firm expects restructuring actions to be substantially  completed by end-September. A restructuring charge covering severance, facility  consolidation and other related items is expected to be finalized and recorded  in the fiscal third-quarter 2023 (to end-June).
