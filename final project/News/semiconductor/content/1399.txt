Aixtron receives TI’s 2022 Supplier Excellence Award Deposition equipment maker Aixtron SE of  Herzogenrath, near Aachen, Germany has received  the 2022 Supplier Excellence Award from Texas Instruments (TI). With this annual award, the global semiconductor  company honors suppliers whose dedication and commitment in supplying products  and services meet TI’s high standards for excellence. Recipients of the TI Supplier Excellence Award are chosen for their  exemplary performance in cost, environmental and social responsibility,  technology, responsiveness, assurance of supply and quality. Aixtron received the TI award for its new G10-GaN  metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition system (MOCVD) system for producing gallium nitride (GaN)-based power devices.  Besides best-in-class yield, uniformity, productivity and wafer cost, the new system is said to also  offer an all-new design with significantly reduced cleanroom footprint requirements.  The official market launch of the G10-GaN is scheduled for later this year. “For us, it is a great achievement to be  honored with this prestigious award from a true global semiconductor player,  recognizing our innovative technology, production capabilities and our  excellence in customer service,” says Aixtron’s CEO  & president Dr Felix Grawert. “Aixtron has grown out of its roots in niche  markets and, with this award, TI acknowledges our position as a major  semiconductor equipment supplier capable of supporting their high-volume  manufacturing ramp in gallium nitride  (GaN) power electronics. This award  also honors our long-term engagement with Texas Instruments  and the high aspirations our joint teams have for the gallium nitride material system,” he adds. “TI looks to Aixtron  to help us serve our customers, achieve our priorities, and ultimately  become a company that we are personally proud to be a part of,” comments  Rob Simpson, TI’s VP of worldwide procurement & logistics.
