AquiSense adds Deca 30C to PearlAqua family AquiSense Technologies LLC of Erlanger, KY,  USA (which designs and manufactures water disinfection systems based on UV-C  LEDs) has added to its  PearlAqua family by launching the Deca 30C system, offering effective  treatment for larger point-of-use applications and for smaller point-of-entry  applications. With a compact design and easy-to-install features, 30C is  suitable for commercial and industrial water treatment, food and beverage  processing, and residential use. It is suitable for showers,  soda machines, recreational vehicles (RVs), boats, and tiny homes. “This not only fills a gap in our lower-flow-rate  product range but, more importantly, demonstrates our next-generation  PearlAqua design platform,” says president & CEO Oliver Lawal. “We’re using  a newer generation of UV-C LED device, more advanced electronics, integrated UV Intensity Sensor  and increased assembly automation,” he adds. “We listened to customer feedback  and delivered by far the highest-performing UV LED system per unit cost.” The PearlAqua Deca 30C uses UV-C LED technology to provide over  99.99% pathogen reduction at 4gpm (15lpm). Housed in a small-footprint case, it  features either automatic on/off switching, or external triggering. Alarm  outputs are configurable in addition to dynamic power control, which  reduces overall energy consumption and extends lamp replacement intervals.
