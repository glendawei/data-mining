Nexperia launches 650V SiC diodes for demanding power conversion applications Nexperia B.V. of Nijmegen, the Netherlands  (a subsidiary of Wingtech Technology Co Ltd) has introduced a 650V  silicon carbide (SiC) Schottky diode designed for power applications  that require ultra-high performance, low loss, and high efficiency. The 10A, 650V SiC Schottky diode is an  industrial-grade part that addresses the challenges of demanding high-voltage  and high-current applications. These include switched-mode power supplies,  AC–DC and DC–DC converters,  battery-charging infrastructure, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and  photovoltaic inverters and allow for more sustainable operations. Data centers,  for example, equipped with power supplies designed using Nexperia’s  PSC1065K SiC Schottky diode will be better placed to meet rigorous  energy-efficiency standards than those using solely silicon-based solutions.
