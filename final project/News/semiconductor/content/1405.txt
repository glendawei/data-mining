Vector Photonics’ £1m ZEUS project to commercialize 1W artificial intelligence PCSEL Vector Photonics Ltd (which was spun off  from Scotland’s University of Glasgow in 2020, based on research led by  professor Richard Hogg) has  won ZEUS, a £1m industrial research project to commercialize its 1Watt,  all-semiconductor photonic-crystal  surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The ZEUS project leverages Vector Photonics’ existing datacoms  PCSEL commercialization work and is a collaborative fund split comprising  £700,000 from the UK Government agency  Innovate UK (which provides funding and support for business innovation as part of  UK Research and Innovation) and £300,000 from the UK Innovation &  Science Seed Fund (UKI2S). The AI PCSEL will have the increase in computer processing power  necessary to overcome the data transmission bottleneck faced by existing AI  solutions. At 1W, the PCSEL’s optical power will be at least ten times that of  incumbent distributed feedback (DFB)  lasers, which currently operate at a maximum of 100mW. So, where existing AI  chips use multiple DFB lasers to achieve a single data-transmission channel of  suitable optical power, Vector Photonics’ PCSEL is being developed to support  up to 20 data channels per chip. Vector  Photonics claims that PCSELs are increasingly the only realistic enabler of  next-generation AI data transmission, where DFBs are approaching their  practical limit. “ZEUS is a 24-month project covering the design, simulation,  manufacture and test of a 1Watt AI PCSEL,” notes chief technology officer Dr Richard  Taylor. “The full impact of a 1Watt PCSEL on AI chip design is not yet  quantified, as the entire architecture of the chips and systems will change,  but it brings countless manufacturing and energy-saving benefits,” he adds.  “Power consumption, heat and latency are reduced; the PCSEL’s symmetrical  far-field requires less operational power for equivalent performance, so a  further power reduction can be expected here; and the vastly reduced laser count per chip makes manufacture simpler  and the chip smaller, which will undoubtedly improve yield and reliability.”
