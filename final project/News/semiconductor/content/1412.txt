Transphorm GaN products exceed 125 billion field operating hours Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near  Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and  AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs)  for high-voltage power conversion — says that in February its high-reliability GaN semiconductor  products exceeded 125 billion field hours. Transphorm says that its SuperGaN platform is differentiated  through its patented GaN semiconductor technology and an IP portfolio  encompassing over 350 directly owned and more than 1000 overall fundamental  materials through applications patents, appraised at about $170m (based on Intracom Group Intellectual Property  Solutions’ patent valuation models). The firm claims that its GaN FET products: Transphorm says that its expanding network of blue-chip partners,  including controller & integrated driver IC  partners, allows it to efficiently expand its reference designs and solutions footprint, placing it in a strategic  position to take full advantage of a growing market opportunity with  best-in-class technology – performance of GaN with the look and feel of silicon  (easy to use/interface). “This milestone demonstrates our industry-leading reliability for  both low-power and high-power applications of our GaN power solutions,” says president, chief operating officer & co-founder Primit Parikh.  “The past year proved to be a critical step in positioning the company to reach  this operating goal,” he adds. “From a business growth  standpoint, exceeding 125 billion  operating hours with very low  sub-0.2 FIT rates across the power range, coupled with high performance of  our patented solutions, further supports our confidence for growth from our  fast-growing $500m+ long-term pipeline.”
