Riber reports full-year net profit, despite electronic component sourcing constraints For full-year 2022, Riber S.A. of  Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems  as well as evaporation sources – has reported revenue of €27.8m,  down 11% on 2021’s €31.2m. However, Riber stopped  marketing a range of evaporators for the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) market. In addition, despite  the firm’s efforts to diversify its sourcing capacity, supply chain disruption  affecting electronic components resulted in the deferral of the delivery of two  research systems to 2023, totaling €2.9m. MBE systems sales  hence contracted by 15% from €17.4m to €14.8m, for six machines delivered,  compared with eight in 2021. Services &  Accessories revenue  fell by 6% from a high of €13.8m to €13m, representing 46.8% of revenue. Gross margin was  35.2%, stable versus 2021’s 35.4%. Operating expenditure is stable, at €9.8m. R&D  investments totaled €3.2m (12% of revenue), stable compared with 2021. Sales  & marketing costs are up by 18% (in line with the strong growth in order  intake), while administrative costs are stable overall. Compared with a  €1.3m operating profit in 2021, operating income broke even in 2022, impacted  by non-current charges of €1.3m, in particular due to the decision to  discontinue the OLED evaporator product line, which led to the depreciation of  inventories. Net income has  fallen from €1.5m in 2021 to €0.2m in 2022. This included €0.4m of financial  income and expenses, linked primarily to the revaluation in euros of  receivables denominated in US dollars and Yuan. Reflecting the  good level of cash flow from operations and the improvement in working capital  requirements, the cash position at the end of 2022 was positive at €6.1m, up  €0.2m from the end of 2021. Net  financial debt has been reduced from €2.4m to €1.3m. During 2022,  shareholders’ equity fell by €1m to €18.8m, linked to earnings for the year and  the distribution of amounts drawn against the issue premium for 2021 to  shareholders. At the general  meeting on 20 June,  Riber’s Executive Board will submit a proposal to shareholders to approve a  cash payout based on reimbursing part of the issue premium for €0.05 per share (to be released for  payment on 5 July). During 2022, new  order intake improved significantly, including 14 systems (plus an  option for an additional four systems) and a good level of orders recorded for  services and accessories. The order book has  hence more than doubled from €14.8m to €29.9m, including €24.6m for 11 MBE  systems and €5.3m for Services & Accessories. This does not  include the additional order for a production system announced on 20 February, or the  option to buy announced on 8 June  2022 covering four production systems for which the firm orders will be  confirmed in 2023 when the export license is obtained. Riber says that, in  view of the above, it is confident that it can achieve 40% year-on-year revenue growth  to about €40m in full-year 2023, and a significant improvement in profitability. In a still buoyant  market, with robust demand for its systems, Riber expects to continue taking orders  in 2023, capitalizing on a strong pipeline of prospects. At a meeting  chaired by Ms Annie  Geoffroy, Riber’s  Supervisory Board appointed Christian Dupont as chairman of the  Executive Board from 13 April,  replacing Michel Picault, who is still a member of the Executive Board. Riber reckons that the appointment  will make it possible to ramp up its robust growth and expansion in a buoyant  market environment. After graduating  as an engineer from EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), Christian  Dupont began his career in 1988 with Texas Instruments, where in 1992 he helped  create its Wireless business unit,  which became the wireless semiconductor market leader for 15 years. He was a  marketing nanager before being appointed to head up the business unit wireless USA  in Dallas and Nice, where he was in charge of the wireless business unit in Europe.  From 2007 to 2010, he was CEO of the electro-optics startup Varioptic, which  was sold to Parrot, before serving until 2015 as CEO of MEMS auto-focus firm PoLight  in Norway, which listed on Oslo’s stock market. From 2015 to 2021, he was  chairman & CEO of CEO-CF, a collaboration platform for executives from  high-growth European technology companies. In 2018, as CEO, he helped  restructure and refinance semiconductor firm Dolphin Integration, which was  taken over by Soitec and MBDA. From 2019, he was CEO of digital health firm Digitsole.
