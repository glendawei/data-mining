Sivananthan Labs completes Phase II STTR program Sivananthan Laboratories Inc of Bolingbrook, IL, USA, a business incubator  in infrared sensing and imaging, has completed a $1.5m award from the Small Business  Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II program for the development of an  entangled short-wavelength infrared (En-SWIR) photon source. The contract was  awarded to further the development, fabrication and evaluation of a gallium arsenide  (GaAs)-based nano-structured source emitting entangled photons at the standard  optical communication wavelength of 1550nm and for the development of  metasurface-enhanced detectors at the same wavelength. This follows a Phase I that established proof of concept and  demonstrated the potential of the fast-emerging field of quantum sensing, which  promises many orders of magnitude enhancements in imaging, sensing, computing,  metrology and communication, in addition to offering opportunities to further  the understanding of fundamental physics. The entangled photon source proposed by Sivananthan Laboratories  has the potential for several orders of magnitude enhancement in efficiency and  brightness over state-of-the-art sources, it is reckoned. “When used as part of the imaging system envisioned by our  company, En-SWIR provides increased signal-to-noise ratio, allowing for  non-direct-line-of-sight imaging of distant objects with increased image  quality and low power consumption, making it ideally suitable for  space-based applications,” says project lead Dr Paul Boieriu. “The  developments from this phase of study will provide critical assistance to our  national efforts to produce entangled photon sources operating at room  temperature,” adds Dr Srini Krishnamurthy, STTR contract program manager  at Sivananthan. Featuring advanced image processing algorithms, the En-SWIR  entangled photon source and detector system envisioned by Sivananthan Laboratories  ultimately promises to be an enabling technology for rapid and effective  decision making, increasing the speed and reach of disruption of any defense  forces. It is consistent with Sivananthan Laboratories’ business model and  long-standing commitment to developing advanced technology for the US military.
