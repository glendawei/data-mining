Guerrilla RF implements one-for-six reverse stock split Guerrilla RF Inc (GRF) of Greensboro,  NC, USA — a provider of radio frequency (RF) and microwave communication  solutions for wireless OEMs — is  implementing a one-for-six reverse split  of its outstanding and authorized common stock,  effective at 12:01am (EDT) on 17 April.  The common stock continues trading  under the temporary symbol ‘GUERD’ on a reverse stock-split-adjusted basis on  the OTCQX market. The reverse stock split was approved by the firm’s board of  directors and shareholders on 5 April,  for the purpose of filing an application to uplist Guerrilla RF’s common stock to a national securities exchange. The reverse  stock split is intended to fulfill  the stock price requirements for  initial listing. “Uplisting to a national securities exchange will allow us greater  access to capital, better liquidity, and more visibility for our brand as we  embark on the next phase of our commercialization strategy,” believes Sam  Funchess, VP of investor relations. “This coincides with our focus on expanding  the depth and breadth of our product pipeline and moving into the highly  lucrative industry verticals — 5G, automotive connectivity, cellular boosters  and DAS, military radios, and wireless audio,” he adds. “This is an important  step in our previously announced capital markets strategy to increase the  liquidity and visibility of Guerrilla RF’s  common stock and better serve our shareholders.”
