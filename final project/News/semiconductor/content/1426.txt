Silanna UV presenting 235nm far-UVC LEDs using new SPSL technology At the International Conference on UV LED Technologies &  Applications (ICULTA 2023) in Berlin, Germany (23-26 April), as well  as being a Silver sponsor UV-C LED maker Silanna UV of Brisbane, Australia is presenting new technology that is  said to push the boundaries of far-UVC LEDs to emit at shorter  wavelengths, at higher power, and with longer lifetimes. On 24 April (10-10.30am), product development manager  William Lee is giving a talk ‘High Power 235nm far UVC LED using  SPSL technology’. The firm is also exhibiting its SF1 series 235nm and SF3 series  255nm UV LEDs. The new UVC LED technology offers advantages for applications  as diverse as disinfection, water quality monitoring, gas sensing,  liquid chromatography, and chemical and biological analysis. Conventional aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN)-based  far-UVC LEDs in general suffer from poor carrier injection, low light emission  and high drive voltage, due to the inherit limitations of  high-aluminium-content AlGaN. Silanna’s new short-period superlattice (SPSL) far-UVC LED  structure helps to overcome these issues. In an SPSL device, composed of  repeating layers of AlN and GaN, the presence of GaN maintains the TE (transverse electric)  dominance of the emission as well as lowering the activation energy of donors,  resulting in more efficient devices compared with LEDs made with the conventional  AlGaN technology. Furthermore, the emission wavelength can be easily tuned  using the thickness of the GaN well. This process is significantly easier to  control than tuning of Al composition in the barrier and well, notes Silanna UV.
