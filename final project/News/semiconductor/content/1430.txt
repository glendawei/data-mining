Odyssey delivers vertical GaN product samples to lead customers in Q1 Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies Inc of  Ithaca, NY, USA, which develops high-voltage vertical power switching  components based on proprietary gallium nitride (GaN) processing  technology, says that it  delivered vertical GaN product samples  to lead customers in first-quarter 2023, as planned, and remains on track to  sign product development agreements  with customers by the end of second-quarter 2023. “We set an aggressive goal to deliver vertical GaN product samples in Q1. Now that we’ve delivered  product samples to lead customers, we’re focused in Q2/2023 on delivery of  samples to additional customers and signing product development agreements with customers, which will lead to  large-scale commercialization,” says CEO Mark Davidson. “Lead customers have  collaborated along the way and have validated the performance metrics expected  from vertical GaN for power  applications,” he adds. “We are actively engaged in multiple product definition  conversations with leading EV automotive customers, as well as industrial motor and renewable energy customers. The market demand and  interest are strong, and we remain focused on executing our commercialization  roadmap,” concludes Davidson. Odyssey is continuing to take product sample  requests.
