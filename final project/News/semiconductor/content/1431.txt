Progress towards complementary GaN on silicon Researchers in the USA, Bangladesh and the  United Arab Emirates report progress in developing complementary transistor  technology (CT) on a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon (Si) substrate platform [Qingyun Xie et al, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,  v70, p2121, 2023]. The team from Massachusetts Institute of  Technology in the USA, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, and  Technology Innovation Institute in the United Arab Emirates, report: “To the  best of the authors’  knowledge, the best p-FET in this work features the highest current density among MOCVD III–N p-FET (>2× the previous record, −140mA/mm), as well as  competitive performance compared with GaN/AlN molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) counterparts” The p-channel field effect transistors  (p-FETs) were integrated with n-FETs with a view to wafer-level heterogeneous  integration of GaN complementary circuits (based on a silicon substrate) with silicon  complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology to achieve  multi-functional chips. Complementary circuits using p-FETs and  n-FETs in enhancement mode (normally off) reduces static power consumption,  and has been key to the success of mainstream silicon electronics. Transferring  this capability to GaN could extend their reach beyond compact, efficient power management — deployed in data centers, power adapters, electric vehicles (EVs), and 5G/6G telecommunications — to more sophisticated  applications requiring control loops and analog mixed-signal blocks. The use of  p-FETs in GaN circuits could also enable higher switching speeds for more efficient and higher-density power converters.
