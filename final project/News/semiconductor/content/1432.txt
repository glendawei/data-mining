Lumentum reduces March-quarter revenue guidance from $430-460m to $380-384m For its fiscal  third-quarter 2023 (ended 1 April), Lumentum  Holdings Inc of San Jose, CA, USA (which designs and makes optical  and photonic products for optical networks and lasers for industrial and  consumer markets) has reduced its revenue guidance from the prior  $430-460m to $380-384m (down on $395.4m a year  previously). “Late in our  fiscal 2023 third quarter, a network equipment manufacturer who represented  more than 10% of our fiscal second-quarter revenue informed us that, due to  their inventory management, they would not take the shipments we had originally  projected for the quarter. This shortfall is the primary reason that our fiscal  2023 third-quarter revenue will be below the low end of our prior guidance  range,” says president & CEO Alan Lowe. “Looking ahead, we expect a similar  level of shipments to this customer in our fiscal Q4, as we saw in Q3. Nevertheless,  our customer relationship remains strong, and we continue to work together  closely to help them achieve success,” he adds. “We have  confidence in our long-term strategy and operating model, and today we are  announcing an increase in our share repurchase  program,” Lowe continues. Lumentum’s  board of directors recently approved an increase in its share repurchase program authorization to an  aggregate $1.2bn and extended its duration through May 2025. The firm’s  previously announced authorization was $1bn through May 2024. As of 1 April, $615.5m had been used to  repurchase 7.4 million shares.  Lumentum expects to fund the repurchases under the extended share repurchase program out of its existing  cash balance.
