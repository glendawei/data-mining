EPC releases Phase-15 Reliability Report Efficient Power Conversion Corp  (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which  makes enhancement-mode gallium nitride  on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors  (FETs) and integrated circuits for  power management applications – has  issued its Phase-15 Reliability Report,  documenting continued work using test-to-fail methodology and adding specific  reliability metrics and predictions for real-world applications including solar optimizers, light detection & ranging LiDAR) sensors, and DC–DC  converters. The report presents the results of testing  eGaN devices to the point of failure, which provides the information to  identify intrinsic failure mechanisms of the devices. By identifying these,  physics-based models that accurately project the safe operating life of a  product over a more general set of operating conditions are developed. This is  applied to information from real-world experience to determine mission  robustness for specific applications. The report is divided into nine sections, each  dealing with a different failure mechanism or application case: “The release of EPC’s  Phase-15 reliability report examines information from real-world experience  that either confirms the laboratory-derived data or opens new questions about  mission robustness that leads to a deeper understanding of the behavior of GaN  devices over a wide range of stress conditions,” notes CEO & co-founder  Dr Alex Lidow.
