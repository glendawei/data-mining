DENSO develops its first inverter using SiC power semiconductors Automotive supplier DENSO Corp of Kariya, Aichi  prefecture, Japan has developed its first inverter based on silicon carbide  (SiC). Incorporated in the eAxle (an electric driving module developed by BluE  Nexus Corp), the inverter will be used in the new RZ, Lexus’ first  dedicated battery electric vehicle (BEV) model, released on 30 March. DENSO says that SiC power semiconductors with its  unique trench-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure improve the output  per chip due to reducing the power loss caused by heat generation. The  structure achieves high voltage and low on-resistance operation. Based on technology jointly developed with Toyota  Central R&D Labs Inc, DENSO says that it utilizes SiC epitaxial wafers  incorporating the results of work commissioned by New Energy and  Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). As a result, the firm  reckons that it has halved the number of crystal defects that prevent the  device from operating normally due to the disorder of the atomic arrangement of  the crystal. Reducing the crystal defect density ensures the  quality of SiC power semiconductor devices used in vehicles and their  stable production, says the firm. DENSO calls its SiC technology ‘REVOSIC’ and is  using it to develop technologies for products ranging from wafers to  semiconductor devices and modules such as power cards.
