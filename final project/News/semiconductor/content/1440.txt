CVD Equipment’s revenues grow more than 50% year-on-year For fourth-quarter 2022, CVD Equipment Corp  of Central Islip, NY, USA (a  designer and maker of chemical vapor  deposition, physical vapor transport, gas and chemical delivery  control systems, and other equipment and process  solutions for developing and manufacturing materials and coatings) has  reported revenue of $7.2m, up 53% on $4.7m a year ago. This took full-year revenue to $25.8m for 2022,  up 57% on 2021’s $16.4m. Quarterly operating expenses have risen from $1.8m in Q4/2021 to  $2.2m in Q4/2022, increasing full-year operating expenses from $7.7m in 2021 to  $8.5m for 2022. Quarterly operating loss has been cut from $1m in Q4/2021 to  $0.22m in Q4/2022, helping to reduce full-year operating loss from $4.7m in  2021 to $1.8m for 2022. Net income was $1.5m ($0.23 per share) in Q4/2022. However, this  came entirely from the recognition of an Employee Retention Credit. This  contrasts with Q4/2021’s net loss of $1.2m ($0.18 per share). Full-year net  loss of $0.22m ($0.03 per share) for 2022 contrasts with net income of $4.7m ($0.71  per share) in 2021, but that included gains of $6.9m on the sale of a building  and $2.4m on forgiveness of a PPP loan. During 2022, cash and cash equivalents have fallen from $16.7m to $14.4m. “CVD Equipment Corporation’s primary objective over the past two  years has been to bring the company to profitability through a focus on products  that serve high-growth markets, specifically high-power electronics,  electric vehicle (EV) battery materials/energy storage and aerospace  & defense – all of which have the objective of improving energy efficiency,”  says president & CEO Manny Lakios. Order bookings were $9.2m in Q4/2022, taking full-year bookings to  $33.1m. Order backlog was $17.8m at the end of 2022. “In the high-power electronics market, we saw demand for silicon carbide  wafers to support high-power electronics for energy storage and  transmission/charging resulting in a multi-system order from a US-based silicon carbide  wafer manufacturer,” says Lakios.  “Through 31 December 2022, we have received orders for 30 of our PVT150  physical vapor transport systems from this customer, which uses our  systems to grow silicon carbide crystals that are made into 150mm silicon carbide  wafers. During the second half of 2022, we initiated the marketing launch of  the PVT150 on our website and at a leading trade show. We plan to increase our  marketing efforts for the PVT product line as well as expand our product  offerings to manufacturers of silicon carbide wafers,” he adds. “In battery materials and energy storage market, we  experienced increased interest and demand for nanotechnology materials including  carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) to  support the development and manufacturing for battery materials used in  electric vehicles,” Lakios  continues. “We received two system orders in 2021 to deposit coatings  onto powders used in silicon-graphite anodes, including a production system and  a second for research and material development. Both systems were completed in  2022.”
