Re-assessing internal quantum efficiency assumptions YC Chiu and C Bayram of University of  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the USA have presented measurements that  question the usual assumption that internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of light-emitting diode (LED) structures are close to 100% at low temperature [Appl. Phys. Lett., v122, p091101, 2023].  Figure 1: Impact of estimating absolute  IQE from low-temperature value. Relative IQEs: 100% at 10K and 58% at 300K.  Absolute IQEs: 71% at 10K, 41% at 300K. One would point out that high  temperature is to left of graphs here (and below). IQEs at room temperature (~300K) are often estimated  (Figure 1) based on photoluminescence  experiments that compare the emission intensity with that at low temperature (~10K). These IQEs are then  used to estimate other factors such as light extraction efficiency etc.
