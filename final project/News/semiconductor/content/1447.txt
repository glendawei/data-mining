India awards financial incentives to First Solar’s Tamil Nadu manufacturing facility Cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic  (PV) module maker First Solar Inc  of Tempe, AZ, USA says that its manufacturing facility in India has been awarded  financial incentives under the Indian government’s Production Linked Incentive  (PLI) program. First Solar was one of only three manufacturers selected to  receive the full range of incentives, which are reserved for fully vertically  integrated manufacturing. The incentives are subject to the facility meeting  product efficiency and domestic value creation thresholds, which will be evaluated  on a quarterly basis from second-quarter 2026 through 2031. The PLI program is intended to promote the  manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules in India and to reduce India’s  dependency on foreign imports of solar modules. Under the scheme, manufacturers  are selected through a competitive bid process and receive certain cash  incentives over a five-year period following the commissioning of their  manufacturing facilities. Among other things, such incentives are based on the  efficiency and temperature coefficient of the modules produced, the proportion  of raw materials sourced  from the domestic market, the extent to which the manufacturer’s operations are  fully integrated within India, and the quantity of modules sold from such  manufacturing operations.
