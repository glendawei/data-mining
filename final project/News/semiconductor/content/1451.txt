Qorvo’s RF Fusion22 wins 2023 GTI Award Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which provides  core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and defense  applications) says that its  RF Fusion22 chipset has won the  2023 GTI Innovative Breakthrough in  Mobile Technology Award. The award  recognizes Qorvo’s technical innovation in 5G chipsets,  which combine compact, high-performance 5G functionality  for leading smartphone manufacturers. This is the third time that Qorvo’s 5G  offerings have been recognized with the GTI Award. The Global TD-LTE Initiative (GTI) is an open global association  of operators and vendors dedicated to promoting the development of TD-LTE and  5G. The GTI Awards program recognizes the  most outstanding achievements and success in the industry and encourages the  development of innovative products, services and applications. Qorvo previously  won GTI’s Innovative Breakthrough in  Mobile Technology Awards in 2020 for  its RF Fusion 5G chipset  and in 2018 for its 5G RF Front End (RFFE). “This award underscores Qorvo’s commitment to technology and  product leadership in 5G RF front ends,” says Frank Stewart, president of Qorvo’s  Advanced Cellular business. “We are  proud to offer designers an outstanding solution that fits their new 5G  smartphone designs.” Qorvo says that its Fusion22 solution enables next-generation,  high-performance functionality to support the continued expansion of 5G into  all tiers of the mobile device market. The chipset draws from bulk  acoustic wave (BAW), silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and gallium arsenide (GaAs)  heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) technologies and deep experience in  radio architecture to provide a high-performance solution for the next  generation of 5G handsets. Each module is optimized and tested as a complete  reference design, enabling manufacturers to leverage pre-validated  interoperability and high levels of integration to minimize engineering effort  and lower design risk.
