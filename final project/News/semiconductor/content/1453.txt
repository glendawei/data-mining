VueReal to create 75 new jobs over three years, aided by Invest Ontario and SDTC funding Invest Ontario is  providing investment support to VueReal Inc of Waterloo, ON, Canada to enhance its technology manufacturing capabilities in the  province. With funding assistance from Invest Ontario and Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC), VueReal plans to  create 75 new jobs over three years in  the Kitchener-Waterloo area. The project will boost  commercial capacity for VueReal’s micro-LED displays. Based on its microSolid semiconductor  fabrication process, VueReal’s printing technology platform enables it to offer  customized display manufacturing services for both niche and mainstream  markets. The firm’s displays are used in various electronic products, including  computers, phones, television and smartwatches, as well as monitors in the  aerospace, automotive and medical technology industries. Since micro-LEDs can reduce  energy consumption in electronic displays, the micro-LED display market  is forecasted to grow to US$11.5bn by 2026, according to Research and Markets. VueReal  reckons it is positioned to capitalize on this growth and aims to become the  North American leader in micro-LED  production. Invest Ontario is  contributing a $2m grant – through the Invest Ontario Fund – subject to executing a definitive agreement,  to boost VueReal’s innovation and production in Canada’s largest tech hub. The federal government is also providing $8.5m through  its SDTC fund. The collaboration between Invest Ontario and SDTC to fund VueReal’s micro-LED technology  project marks an important milestone in the evolution of both organizations, it  is reckoned. “Our focus is to  strengthen the manufacturing supply chain and  accelerate financial supports to companies like VueReal that can drive rapid  growth and compete in a hyper-competitive market,” says Invest Ontario’s CEO Trevor Dauphinee. Ontario’s technology  sector comprises over 408,000 skilled IT professionals and more than 65,000  STEM graduates each year. VueReal is one of almost 25,000 tech businesses in  the province, contributing over $48bn annually to the technology sector’s  GDP. “Canada’s great universities,  including the University of Waterloo, combined with government research funds,  make it a prime location for developing cutting-edge and sustainable  technologies,” comments VueReal’s CEO  & founder Reza Chaji. “VueReal has leveraged this ecosystem to  develop its microSolid printing technologies, which enable the creation of  smart surfaces for next-generation displays and sensor applications,” he adds. “Moreover, a recent  collaboration between VueReal, SDTC and Invest Ontario on a project worth approximately $40m highlights  the potential to scale these technologies into full-scale production in the  Waterloo Region and Ontario,” continues Chaji. “These innovative technologies  have a significant role in generating employment opportunities in today’s modern  economy and hold strategic importance for multiple industries, such as consumer electronics, healthcare, medical, security, automotive,  aerospace and more.” Other major tech  companies, such as Amazon, Blackberry, Cisco, Ericsson, Google, LG, OpenText  and Shopify, have also established R&D operations in Ontario, making it the  second-largest IT cluster in North America after California’s Silicon Valley, it is reckoned.
