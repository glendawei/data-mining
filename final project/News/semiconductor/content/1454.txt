ACM receives first purchase order for Ultra C SiC substrate cleaning tool ACM Research Inc of Fremont, CA, USA,  which develops and manufactures wafer processing equipment for semiconductor  device and advanced wafer-level packaging (WLP) applications, has —  through its operating subsidiary ACM Research (Shanghai) Inc —  received the first purchase order (PO) for its Ultra C silicon carbide  (SiC) substrate cleaning tool. The platform leverages ACM’s patented Space Alternated  Phase Shift (SAPS) cleaning technology, which is designed to achieve more  comprehensive cleaning without damage to device features. The PO was received  from a “leading Chinese SiC substrate manufacturer” and is expected to ship  before the end of third-quarter 2023. ACM notes that increased demand for power semiconductors from  industries such as automotive and renewable energy is driving growth in  the SiC device market, which is expected to exceed $4bn by 2026, according  to market analyst firm Yole Développement. “The power semiconductor market is experiencing strong growth,  with the electric vehicle market and related infrastructure seeing rapidly  accelerating deployments,” says ACM’s founder & CEO David Wang. “This order  represents the successful application of ACM’s experience in advanced  semiconductor wafer processing equipment to meet the unique requirements of SiC  substrate manufacturing,” he adds. “We remain committed to expanding our product  portfolio to support additional market opportunities.” ACM’s Ultra C SiC substrate cleaning tool uses SC1  (ammonia/hydrogen peroxide), SC2 (hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide),  DHF and other chemicals for the cleaning process, and can also be equipped with  ACM’s proprietary Smart Megasonix to achieve better cleaning performance. The  tool is 6- and 8-inch compatible and is designed to achieve throughput of more  than 70 wafers per hour. The tool has been optimized for  handling fragile SiC substrates to minimize breakage.
