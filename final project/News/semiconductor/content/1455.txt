Ruggedness of CGD’s ICeGaN technology proven by Virginia Tech Fabless semiconductor company Cambridge  GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) — which was spun out of the University of Cambridge  Department of Engineering’s Electrical Power and Energy Conversion  group in 2016 by CEO Dr Giorgia Longobardi and professor Florin Udrea and  designs, develops and commercializes power transistors and ICs that use GaN-on-silicon  substrates — says that independent, third-party research by Virginia  Tech University has demonstrated that its ICeGaN gallium nitride technology is more reliable and robust than other  GaN platforms. Presented by researchers from Virginia Tech and CGD’s director of Innovation & Research Daniel  Popa at the Applied Power Electronics  Conference (APEC 2023) in Orlando, FL, USA (19–23 March), the  paper ‘A GaN HEMT with  Exceptional Gate Over-Voltage Robustness’ provides experimental evidence  that shows that ICeGaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs), enabled by smart protection circuitry,  show an exceptionally high over-voltage margin of over 70V (comparable to state-of-the-art traditional  silicon devices) and possibly even higher. “Accidental high drive voltage is a critical concern for the gate  reliability and driver design of GaN HEMT devices,” says Popa.  “State-of-the-art GaN HEMTs survive around 25V, which can be within  gate voltage overshoots in applications such as converters, resulting in  device failure,” he adds. “Until ICeGaN, higher breakdown voltage values  of 70V and more were only possible with state-of-the-art SiC  [silicon carbide] and superjunction devices.” CGD claims that ICeGaN HEMTs possess a unique set of intrinsic  capabilities that, together, elevate device reliability well above current  state-of-the-art GaN devices from competitors, while approaching the ruggedness  of state-of-the-art silicon-based devices. In addition to the hugely elevated  dynamic gate breakdown capability, enabled by the inclusion of fully  integrated GaN smart circuitry, and confirmed by the Virginia Tech  research, ICeGaN technology has a higher voltage threshold of 3V, higher  voltage range (0–20V), and a stronger gate voltage clamping action at  lower temperatures.
