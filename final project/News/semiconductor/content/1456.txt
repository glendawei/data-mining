Cree LED launches record-efficacy 228lm/W high-power LED Cree LED Inc of Durham, NC, USA (a company of  SMART Global Holdings of Milpitas, CA) has launched J Series 5050C E Class LEDs, which  have what is claimed to be the industry’s highest efficacy for high-power LEDs  of 228 lumens per watt (LPW) typical at 4000K, 70 CRI (color rendering index) and 1W. The new J Series LEDs deliver what is reckoned to be up to  three times the light output of competing 5050 LEDs at the same efficacy  level. The LEDs are also designed with what is claimed to be superior corrosion  resistance for the most challenging environments. With the addition of the new E Class LEDs, Cree LED now  offers four performance levels in the J Series 5050 LED portfolio to  address most directional general lighting applications. Unlike other 5050s  with asymmetric die layouts that reduce intensity through secondary optics, J Series 5050  LEDs feature optimized layouts that deliver peak intensities up to 12.5% higher  than the competition, it is reckoned, as well as improved color-over-angle. “The breakthrough performance of 5050C E Class LEDs enables  substantial system cost savings through the reduction in optics, PCBs and chassis  material. Up to 40% system cost savings and 57% reduction in size are possible  when redesigning from a lower-performance 5050 LED to the 5050C E Class  LED,” says David Peoples, VP of marketing. “To speed up the design-in process,  5050C E Class LEDs are compatible with optics designed for existing square LES  [light-emitting surface] 5050 LEDs.” Suitable for outdoor area, high/low-bay, roadway and indoor  professional applications, the new 5050C E Class LEDs are available in  2200–6500K correlated color temperatures (CCTs) as well as 70, 80  and 90 CRI options for all CCTs. Product samples are available now and production quantities are  available with standard lead times.
