GaN on silicon through surface-activated bonding Researchers from UK, China and Japan have  been exploring the potential of surface-activated bonding (SAB) as a means to  create high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon (Si) with a view to  low-cost, large-scale and multi-functional GaN/Si device applications [Yan Zhou et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v122, p082103, 2023]. The technique avoids thick aluminium  gallium nitride (AlGaN) heterostructures of direct GaN growth on silicon. Such  layers are needed to bridge the large 17% lattice mismatch between GaN and silicon  generating performance-sapping dislocations and other defects. The main  attraction of using GaN/Si — rather than better matched silicon carbide, diamond or free-standing GaN substrates —  is cost. The drawback for applications —  particularly ones involving heat generation such as for high-power/voltage management,  for which there is much interest in GaN-based devices — is that these layers  tend to be thermally resistive. This makes thermal management much more  difficult. The team — from University of Bristol in  the UK; State Key Laboratory of Superlattices and Microstructures, University  of Science and Technology of China, Center for High Pressure Science and  Technology of Advanced Research, and Harbin Institute of Technology, Beijing  University of Technology in China; and Osaka City University and Osaka Metropolitan  University in Japan — also found that annealing could convert the relatively  thick amorphous layer of the bond formed at room temperature to a much thinner crystalline layer.
