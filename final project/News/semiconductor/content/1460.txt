Navitas launches GaNSense Control ICs Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and  silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance,  CA, USA has launched a family  of GaNSense Control ICs that deliver what it claims are unprecedented  levels of performance and integration. Power systems require  an optimized, high-speed, low-voltage (LV) silicon system controller, which Navitas has developed and integrated  with its high-performance GaN ICs to  create the first GaNSense control IC  technology. The initial range of GaNSense Control  features high-frequency quasi-resonant (HFQR) flybacks supporting QR, DCM  (discontinuous conduction mode), CCM (continuous conduction mode) and multiple-frequency, hybrid-mode  operations, with frequencies up to 225kHz. The range is provided in a single,  surface-mount QFN package (NV695x-series) or as a chip-set (NV9510x + NV61xx)  for maximum designer flexibility. On the secondary side, integrated synchronous  rectifier (SR) power ICs (NV97xx)  achieve maximum efficiency at any load condition compared with conventional  rectifiers.
