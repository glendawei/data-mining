ST extends VIPerGaN power converter range to 65W and 100W STMicroelectronics of Geneva, Switzerland has extended its high-voltage  wide-bandgap power converter family by adding the VIPerGaN100 and  VIPerGaN65 for single-switch quasi-resonant (QR) flyback converters up to 100W  and 65W. The compact and highly integrated design targets switched-mode power supplies  (SMPS) for USB-PD chargers, home appliances, smart-building controllers,  lighting, air conditioning, smart metering, and other industrial  applications. Each device integrates a pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller  and a 650V enhancement-mode gallium nitride (GaN) power transistor  and allows secondary-side regulation using a standard optocoupler. Housed in a  5mm x 6mm QFN package, the small footprint and advanced integration ensure  superior power density and save bill-of-materials (BoM) costs, it is  claimed. Also, the wide-bandgap transistor technology enhances energy efficiency  and simplifies thermal management. With advanced power management and low quiescent current, the  converters consume standby power of less than 30mW operating in adaptive burst  mode. Each operates in quasi-resonant mode, with dynamic blanking time and  valley synchronization to reduce switching losses and maximize efficiency at  all input line and load conditions. This assists in reducing energy usage,  helping to meet eco-design codes targeting global energy savings and  net-zero carbon emissions, says ST. Integrated features to ensure safety and reliability include input voltage  feedforward compensation to minimize peak power variation, output  overvoltage protection, current sensing, input overvoltage protection, and  brown-in and brown-out protection. Thermal shutdown is also included, as well  as frequency jittering to suppress EMI. The VIPerGaN100 and VIPerGaN65 are in production now, each in the  5mm x 6mm QFN package, priced from $2.93 for VIPerGaN100 and $2.62 for  VIPerGaN65, for orders of 1000 units.
