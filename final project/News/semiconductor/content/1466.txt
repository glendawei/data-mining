EPC adds 15A and 25A devices to 100V power stage IC range Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo,  CA, USA — which makes enhancement-mode  gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors  (FETs) and integrated circuits for power management applications —  has introduced  two new 100V power stage ICs rated at 15A (EPC23104)  and 25A (EPC23103). The two devices join the  100V 35A power stage IC EPC23102. The three ICs are capable of  a maximum withstand voltage of 100V and integrate a complete GaN  half-bridge power stage that includes symmetrical FETs in half-bridge  configuration, half-bridge driver, level shifter, bootstrap charging, and  input logic interface. The three devices feature a  thermally enhanced QFN package measuring only 3.5mm x 5mm  with exposed top for dual-side cooling and wettable flanks. Footprint  compatibility enables customers to upgrade their design for better performance  or lower cost without modification to the board, and therefore can easily adapt  to changing load requirements. In DC–DC applications, the devices can operate with high efficiency at high switching frequency  (3MHz maximum) and offer higher performance and smaller solution size  for 28V–60V DC–DC in computing, industrial and USB PD 3.1  applications. In 32V–48V BLDC motor drives for e-mobility, robotics, power tools  and drones, the device can operate with small deadtimes (21ns) and at 100kHz to  increase the system efficiency due to less motor core losses and  vibrations, and to reduce or eliminate the electrolytic capacitors. “The  ePower family of products makes it easy for designers to take advantage of the  significant performance improvements made possible with GaN technology,” says  CEO & co-founder Alex Lidow. “Integrated devices are easier to design,  easier to layout, easier to assemble, save space on the PCB, and increase  efficiency. Designers can use these devices to make lighter-weight and more  precise brushless DC (BLDC) motor drives,  higher-efficiency 48V input DC–DC converters, higher-fidelity class-D audio systems,  and other industrial and consumer applications.” The development boards  EPC90151 and EPC90152 are half-bridge demo boards featuring the EPC23103 and  the EPC23104 ePower Stage IC, respectively. The purpose of the  boards is to simplify the evaluation process of the EPC23103 and the EPC23104.  These 2” x 2”  (50.8mm x 50.8mm)  boards are designed for optimal switching performance and contain all critical  components for easy evaluation. The EPC23103 is priced at  $3.75 each in 1000-unit volumes. The EPC23104 is priced at $3.00 each in  1000-unit volumes. The EPC90151 and EPC90152 development boards are priced at $200  each. All devices and boards are available for immediate delivery from distributor  Digi-Key Corp.
