Power Integrations launches 900V GaN flyback switcher ICs Power Integrations Inc of San Jose, CA,  USA, which provides high-voltage integrated circuits for energy-efficient  power conversion, has announced a  900V gallium nitride (GaN) extension to its InnoSwitch3 family of flyback  switcher ICs. Featuring the firm’s  proprietary PowiGaN technology, the new ICs deliver up to 100W with better than  93% efficiency, eliminating the need for heat sinks and streamlining the  design of space-challenged applications. InnoSwitch3 designs also  offer what is said to be exceptional light-load efficiency, making them suitable  for providing auxiliary power in electric vehicles during low-power sleep modes.  The AEC-Q100-qualified InnoSwitch3-AQ family is particularly suitable for EVs  based on 400V bus systems where the 900V PowiGaN switch provides more power and  increased design margin ― required for 12V battery-replacement systems ―  with enhanced efficiency over silicon-based converters.
