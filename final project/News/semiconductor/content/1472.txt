Oxford Instruments accelerating qualification programs for Plasma Polish production ramp in 2023 UK-based Oxford Instruments says that, with intensive qualification  projects underway with several leading manufacturers, it has been confirmed  that its Plasma Polish technique can be applied, with  great effect, to improve silicon carbide (SiC) substrate surface and  reduce subsurface damage for multiple production processes, where SiC crystal  quality is a critical yield-limiting factor. Launched by Oxford Instruments at the International  Conference on Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM 2022)  in Davos, Switzerland last September, the  200mm-compatible SiC substrate polishing technique is being tested with  commercial partners at several points in the SiC device fabrication  supply chain, such as boule growth, pre- and post-epi and in between  epitaxial layers, to meet higher-voltage device requirements. In addition, the  repeatability and damage-reducing benefits of Plasma Polish have also been  demonstrated with 12 suppliers across the USA, Europe, Middle-East & Africa  (EMEA) and Asia, with the process therefore proving to be an effective solution  on any given SiC material. Qualification of the technique has demonstrated what is described  as state-of-the-art surface and subsurface damage reduction capability,  targeting maximum power device yield. In addition to technical advantages,  Plasma Polish brings opportunities to reduce the polishing cost of SiC  substrates across multiple steps in the supply chain, while at the same  time reducing the environmental impact of the process, says the firm. An  alternative approach to chemical mechanical polish (CMP), Plasma Polish  lends itself to the production of high-yield, cost-effective power devices –  helping to address a key challenge to SiC adoption. Oxford Instruments says that, with significant market  interest in Plasma Polish coming from key customers throughout the SiC  supply chain, it is at advanced stages of qualification with multiple  companies and is ramping up Plasma Polish module production. “The engagement we have had with customers so far has been  phenomenal, and we are continuously confirming the benefits Plasma Polish  offers to solve current and future technical challenges hampering SiC  adoption,” says Bas Derksema, global sales & marketing director at  Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology (OIPT)  of Yatton, near Bristol, UK. “Both gallium nitride and silicon carbide  are key to Oxford Instruments’ growth plans in the wide-bandgap power  space, and we have production solutions and a very exciting leading-edge  development pathway aligned to our customers’ current and future challenges,”  he adds. “Our new Severn Beach production and research facility,  coming online in the next 12 months, increases our production capacity by  over 50%, with a doubling of application lab space, which will allow us to  continue developing market-leading innovative solutions, and ramp up our  production capacity to respond to growing market demand.” At the Applied Power Electronics Conference & Exposition  (APEC 2023) in Orlando, Florida (19-23 March), Oxford Instruments  is on hand to discuss how its SiC and GaN substrate prep, surface  modification, feature etch, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), atomic layer  deposition (ALD) and Etchpoint process solutions can generate more high-quality  wafers per day at lower cost, it is claimed.
