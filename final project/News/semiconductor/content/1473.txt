GaN Systems unveils 11kW/800V on-board charger reference design At the Applied Power Electronics Conference  (APEC 2023) in Orlando, FL, USA (19–23 March), GaN Systems Inc  of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of gallium nitride-based  power switching semiconductors for power conversion and control  applications) has unveiled a  new GaN-based 11kW/800V on-board charger  (OBC) reference design that is  claimed to deliver 36% higher power density  and up to 15% lower bill of materials (BOM) cost compared with  silicon carbide (SiC) transistors. The OBC combines a three-level flying capacitor topology for a  bridgeless totem-pole power factor  correction (PFC) structure and dual active bridge in the AC/DC and  DC/DC, respectively. The GaN transistors, in the three-level topology with  superior switching performance,  reduce the transistor voltage stress to half and allow the economical 650V GaN  to be used in this and many other 800V applications. Key features of the  OBC design include: GaN power  semiconductors increase the efficiency of the OBC by reducing switching losses and power dissipation during  operation. This improved efficiency reduces power losses  during electric vehicle (EV)  charging, making the OBC significantly more energy efficient  and cost effective, says the firm.  For example, the solution’s higher efficiency reduces the complexity and cost  of the cooling system design. The compact and highly efficient design helps to  reduce the overall size and weight of the OBC, freeing up space and weight that  can be allocated to other areas of the EV design.
