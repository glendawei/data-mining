Vishay showcasing power management solutions at APEC At the Applied  Power Electronics Conference & Exposition (APEC 2023) in Orlando,  Florida (19-23 March), discrete semiconductor  and passive electronic component maker Vishay Intertechnology Inc of Malvern, PA, USA is showcasing its  portfolio of power management solutions addressing the latest trends in  power electronics — from energy harvesting, electric vehicle (EV)  powertrains, and mass commercialization to efficient and effective  power electronics for power tools and switching regulators that  shorten the iterative design cycle. In booth 332, Vishay experts are available to discuss the firm’s  range of passive and semiconductor solutions for these applications, including  the development of 600V and 1200V planar silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET  technology; power inductors that enable high efficiency in gallium nitride  (GaN) DC/DC converters; and integrated power module solutions combining  high-efficiency fast body diode MOSFETs and SiC, FRED Pt, and MOAT  diode technologies to enable higher power density than discrete solutions. Vishay is also giving product-focused demonstrations highlighting  microBUCK and microBRICK switching regulators; IHLE series high-current  inductors; IHPT haptic actuators; MELF and CRCW-HP/RCS thick-film chip  resistors; RCP, PHP, and PCAN thick- and thin-film resistors;  AEC-Q200-qualified CDMM thick-film dividers; and the THJP ThermaWick Thermal Jumper. Application-focused demonstrations include: Additional Vishay passive components on display at APEC include  integrated transformers; wirewound resistors; PTC and NTC thermistors; LPS,  LTO, DTO, and D2TO power thick-film resistors; wireless charging coils; ENYCAP  electrical double-layer storage capacitors; and ceramic and  power electronic capacitors (PEC). Highlighted Vishay semiconductor  solutions consist of 2A to 7A TMBS, 2A to 4A standard, and 1A to 5A FRED Pt  ultrafast rectifiers in Vishay’s first compact, low-profile Power DFN series  package: the industry-first DFN3820A. Also at APEC, on  22 March (12-12:30pm in Theater 1), marketing development manager Jorge  Lugo is presenting an Exhibitor Seminar ‘Optimizing Your Battery Management  System’.
