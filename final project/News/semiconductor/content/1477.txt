Silanna launches its first 100W multi-port fast charger reference design Silanna Semiconductor of San Diego, CA, USA,  which makes AC/DC and DC/DC power converter ICs, has  expanded its family of fast charger  reference designs with its first  100W multi-port offering. Built around its CO2 Smart Power AC/DC controllers and high-frequency DC/DC converters,  the RD-16 integrates a front-end PFC converter stage and provides a  high-power-density, ultra-efficient, production-ready solution for multi-port  100W USB-PD applications delivering currents up to 5A. Silanna says that the RD-16 is a gallium nitride  (GaN)-based solution — using an Innoscience  GaN power transistor — that can simplify and speed charger development by  providing everything an engineer needs to rapidly prototype and test a fully  functional 100W 2C1A multi-port unit. The design is based on the AnyPort  architecture, which offers the flexibility to complete a charger design for a  given power level prior to  specifying and configuring the specific number and type of output ports. By  allowing a single base charger design to be deployed across a variety of end products with different output configurations, AnyPort  can significantly reduce the complexity of fast chargers and adapters with multiple Type-C and/or  Type-A output ports.
