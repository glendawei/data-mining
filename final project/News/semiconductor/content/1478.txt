Infineon providing CoolSiC MOSFETs for Infinitum’s air-core motor drive Infineon  Technologies AG of Munich, Germany is joining forces with Infinitum of  Round Rock, TX, USA, creator of the sustainable air-core motor. Infineon  will provide silicon carbide CoolSiC MOSFETs and other key semiconductor  components that contribute to the Infinitum motor system’s precise motor control,  optimal power and energy savings. The Infinitum  Aircore EC motor for commercial and industrial applications is being showcased  at Infineon’s booth #932 at the 38th annual  Applied Power Electronics Conference  (APEC 2023) in Orlando, FL, USA  (19–23 March). The motor uses  Infinitum’s patented air-core motor design, which replaces the heavy iron used  in traditional motors with a lightweight printed circuit board (PCB). It  is reckoned that the firm’s motors are  50% smaller and lighter, 10% more efficient and use 66% less copper than  traditional motors. “Infineon is a  leading provider of silicon carbide chips and embedded technologies that  can greatly contribute to Infinitum motor system’s value-added features  from an energy, carbon footprint and performance standpoint,” comments Infinitum’s  president Rick Tewell. “We are excited to team with Infineon on our continued  collaboration. The company helps us bring innovative new breakthroughs to our  customers in the industrial sector,” he adds. “Infineon and  Infinitum are two companies with the same mission to drive decarbonization,  with greater efficiency in motor control and less waste in hardware for  industrial applications,” says Michael Williams, director of  product marketing for Infineon’s Industrial Power Control Division.  “With our proven SiC and semiconductor technologies, we are helping Infinitum  deliver more precise motor control for better power and energy savings.”
