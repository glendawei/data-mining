onsemi showcasing intelligent power technologies at APEC In booth 1032 at the Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC 2023) in Orlando, Florida (19-23 March), power semiconductor  IC supplier onsemi of Phoenix, AZ, USA is featuring a diverse range of  demonstrations for the industrial and automotive markets, including an area  dedicated to the EliteSiC silicon carbide family,  complete with an electric vehicle (EV)  charging station. Another showcase  demonstrates the latest industrial power supply  and charging solutions: a 6.6/11kW power factor  correction (PFC)  inverter, an ultra-high-density 240W USB PD 3.1 solution and a 600W battery charger. At APEC, onsemi is introducing and demonstrating a new simulator  for the EliteSiC family. The online tool allows engineers to virtually test and  validate EliteSiC products through an expansive library of customizable circuit  technologies. When the simulator is used with advanced PLECS models, engineers  can gather insights into the application at a very early stage of the design cycle without relying on hardware  fabrication and testing. APEC attendees can learn more about the tool in two  presentations: Alongside the simulator, onsemi is announcing a new series of  1200V Trench Field Stop VII (FS7) insulated-gate bipolar  transistors (IGBTs).  The devices provide low switching loss  and optimized switching to provide high-efficiency operation in various  industrial applications, including motor control,  uninterruptable power supply (UPS)  and solar applications.
