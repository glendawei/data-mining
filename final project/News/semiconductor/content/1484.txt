CSconnected highlighted in UK’s new £2.5bn Quantum Strategy The South Wales-based compound semiconductor cluster CSconnected is  highlighted in the new UK Quantum Strategy announced by Michelle Donelan, Secretary of State for  Science, Innovation and Technology on 15 March. The 10-year plan aims to fund new frontiers of quantum research,  support and develop the growing UK quantum sector, prepare the wider economy  for the quantum revolution and ensure that the UK leads internationally in the  regulation and ethical use of quantum technologies. CSconnected founding  member Compound Semiconductor Centre (CSC, a joint venture founded in 2015 between Cardiff University and Cardiff-based epiwafer  and substrate maker IQE plc)  leads Quantum Foundry (QFoundry), a three-year,  £5.7m project that is part-funded by the UK Quantum Technologies  Challenge, via UK Research and Innovation. Established in 2020, QFoundry harnesses standard semiconductor  fabrication techniques to scale up the manufacture of quantum components that  are critical to a wide range of novel quantum system developments  supported by the UK Quantum Technologies Programme. Quantum technologies are increasingly seen as essential for  ensuring the security of national infrastructure around communications, cybersecurity,  defence and next-generation computing. CSconnnected is highlighted as a key regional asset which is  essential to the long term success of the strategy. “Widescale  adoption of quantum systems need a robust, reliable and volume supply of  semiconductor components to integrate into products to deliver a return on  investment on the science,” comments CSconnected’s chair Wyn  Meredith. “QFoundry  can perhaps be described as the missing piece in pathway to commercialization,  and the project is laying the groundwork towards a new UK quantum component industry,” he  adds. “We look forward to building on the foundations that we have laid in  since 2020, and being a key partner in the new UK strategy.”
