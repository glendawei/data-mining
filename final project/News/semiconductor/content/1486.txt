SHARGE chooses EPC’s GaN FETs for 67W USB PD charger Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes  enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors  (FETs) and integrated circuits for power management applications – has  teamed up with China-based SHARGE Technology to design a 67W USB PD  charger with a power display screen. The Retro 67 fast charger  uses the EPC2218 100V GaN FET,  which can deliver 231A pulsed current in a footprint of just 3.5mm x 1.95mm,  offering designers a significantly smaller, more efficient device than silicon  MOSFET for USB PD fast chargers. EPC2218 provides SHARGE’s All-GaN fast charger  with what is said to be higher efficiency, state-of-the-art power density  and lower system cost. The SHARGE Retro 67 supports 67W of power output, providing full-speed  charging for the latest high-power laptops. The charger has three USB-C ports,  to support multiple device charging. The Retro 67 uses the EPC2218 to achieve the  most efficient power conversion, reducing product size and  enabling a PCBA power density of up to 1.39W/cm3  and an overall power density of 0.85W/cm3  with 90V AC input. The overall conversion efficiency of the SHARGE Retro 67 fast charger  is 92.16% with 230V AC input.
