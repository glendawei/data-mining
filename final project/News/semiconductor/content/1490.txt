Mitsubishi Electric to build new 8-inch SiC fab to boost power semi production Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Electric Corp is to double the  investment plan (that it announced in 2021) from 130bn yen to about 260bn yen  in the five-year period to March 2026, mainly for constructing a new wafer  plant to increase production of silicon carbide (SiC)  power semiconductors. Under the plan, Mitsubishi Electric expects to respond to the  rapidly increasing demand for SiC power semiconductors for  electric vehicles (EVs) as well as expanding markets for new applications  that require, for example, low energy loss, high-temperature operation or  high-speed switching. About 100bn yen of the 130bn yen increased investment will be used  to construct a new 8-inch SiC wafer plant and to enhance related production  facilities. The new factory, which will incorporate an owned facility in the  Shisui area of Kumamoto Prefecture, will produce large-diameter 8-inch SiC  wafers. The firm will also enhance its production facilities for 6-inch SiC  wafers to meet the growing demand in this sector. In addition, Mitsubishi Electric will newly invest about 10bn yen  in a new factory that will consolidate existing operations (currently dispersed  throughout the Fukuoka area) for the assembly and inspection of power  semiconductors. The integration of design, development and production  technology verification is expected to greatly enhance the companyâ€™s development  capabilities and facilitate timely mass production in response to market  demand. The remaining 20bn yen of the new investment will be targeted at  equipment enhancements, environmental arrangements and related operations.
