Aixtron maintains annual revenue and earnings growth despite shipment push-outs and delays to export licenses For fourth-quarter  2022, deposition equipment maker Aixtron SE  of Herzogenrath, near Aachen, Germany has reported revenue of €183.2m,  up slightly (by 1%) from the strong €180.9m a year ago and more than doubling  from Q3/2022’s €88.9m (and the best fourth-quarter in terms of  shipments since 2011). The growth is  attributed to unabated strong demand and stable supply chains plus shipment push-outs from  Q3/2022. “The current  megatrends of sustainability, electrification and digitization create a  continuously high demand in our core markets for our products. Accordingly, we  were able to continue our strong growth from 2021 also in 2022,” notes CEO Dr Felix Grawert. “We have successfully mastered the global  supply chain issues of the year 2022 and also maneuvered around some of  the delays in export licenses that required us to shift some production  slots back and forth within the year.” Full-year revenue grew  by 8% from 2021’s €429m to €463.2m in 2022,  within the guidance range of €450-500m despite some customer-related  delays in delivering systems. On a  geographic basis, Asia fell further, from 70% to 68% of full-year revenue (due  to China plummeting from €211.8m to €150.8m, while Taiwan grew from €66.1m to €77.5m and Korea rocketed from €4.7m  to €40.8m). Europe fell  from 20% to 14%, while the Americas rebounded from 10% to 18% (almost doubling from €43.1m to €83.1m). Of total annual  revenue, 82% came from equipment sales (€380.4m, up 3.8% on 2021’s €366.5m) and  the remaining 18% (€82.8m) came from after-sales (consumables, spare parts  and services).
  Growth was driven by  the ongoing strong demand for efficient gallium nitride (GaN)- and silicon carbide (SiC)-based power electronics, particularly for ecologically  sustainable applications, notes Aixtron. Of the equipment  revenue, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)/chemical vapor  deposition (CVD) systems for making GaN- and SiC-based wide-bandgap Power Electronic devices again comprised the largest share, at 42% or €160.6m (up from 2021’s 38%,  or €139.7m). MOCVD systems for making Optoelectronics  devices (solar, telecoms/datacoms and 3D sensing lasers for  consumer electronics) comprised 28% or €106.2m (down from 2021’s 37%, or €137m). MOCVD systems for  making LEDs comprised 27% or €103.2m (rebounding  from 2021’s 23%), driven by growing demand for micro-LEDs.  Full-year  gross margin held steady at about 42% (above the original guidance of 41%).  Quarterly gross margin was 45%, up from 44% for both Q3/2022 and a year ago,  due mainly to improved product mix. Full-year operating expenses rose from €82.5m in 2021 to €90.6m in  2022 (albeit rising only slightly from 19% to 20% of revenue), driven by higher  variable compensation elements and higher personnel costs after increasing  staffing by 25% (from 718 at the end of 2021 then 842 at  the end of Q3/2022 to 895), combined with slightly  higher R&D spending. The already high level of investment in R&D of €56.8m in 2021 was not only maintained  but even slightly increased, to €57.7m (12% of revenue) in 2022. Full-year operating result (EBIT, earnings  before interest and taxes) rose from 2021’s €99m to €104.7m in 2022 (with EBIT margin remaining  23%, at the top end of the original 21–23% guidance range). Fourth-quarter EBIT was again very  strong at €57.1m, up from €16.2m in Q3/2022 and almost matching Q4/2021’s €57.9m  (which had more than doubled year-on-year from Q4/2020’s €24.5m). Full-year net  profit grew from 2021’s €94.8m (€0.85  per share) to €100.5m (€0.89 per share) in 2022. Quarterly net profit was €50.3m (€0.44 per share), up from €19.1m (€0.28 per share) in Q3/2022 but down only  slightly from €51.9m (€0.46 per share) a year ago. Operating cash  flow was -€0.1m in Q4/2022, compared with €0.5m in Q3/2022 and €25.9m a year  ago. Hence, full-year operating cash flow has fallen from €66.4m in 2021 to  €37.1m for 2022. Capital  expenditure (CapEx) has risen further, from just €4.4m a year ago and €8m in  Q3/2022 to €12.6m in Q4/2022, taking full-year CapEx from 2021’s €17.7m to  €29.5m for 2022, largely comprising investments in new-generation MOCVD tools. In  particular, in anticipation of a further increase in demand, Aixtron increased  its investments in property, plant and equipment (especially in R&D-related  laboratory equipment and expansions) from 2021’s €16.4m to €27.4m in 2022. Quarterly free cash flow has hence gone from €21.5m in  Q4/2021 to –€7.5m  in Q3/2022 then –€11.3m in Q4/2022. Full-year free cash flow has fallen from 2021’s €48.7m to €7.7m for 2022, due mainly to temporary  working capital effects such as high accounts receivables  as a result of the very late shipments in December 2022  as well as further a build-up of inventories from €120.6m at the end of 2021 and €209.2m  at the end of September to €223.6m (due to the push-out of shipments and preparation for the large  number of shipments hence scheduled for subsequent quarters). Cash and cash equivalents (including  financial assets) has fallen further, from  €352.5m at end-2021 and €339.2m at the end of Q3/2022 to €325.2m at the end of 2022. In view of the very positive business development in 2022, at the Annual  General Meeting (AGM)  of shareholders on 17 May Aixtron’s Executive Board  and Supervisory Board will therefore propose to pay a dividend of €0.31 per share (compared with €0.30 per share in 2021). The  total payout of €34.8m (up from €33.7m in 2022) corresponds to a payout ratio of about 35% of net  income for the year. Fourth-quarter 2022 order intake was €160.3m, up 12.3% on €142.8m in Q3/2022 and up 34% on €119.7m in  Q4/2021. Full-year order intake grew by 18% from 2021’s €497.3m to €585.9m in 2022 (the  second highest in the firm’s almost 40-year history, after 2010, and exceeding the  original guidance range of €520–580m and above the mid-point of the  revised guidance range of €540–600m). Aixtron says that this demonstrates the  enduring trend towards efficient GaN and SiC power electronics, which grew  from under 45% of order intake in 2021 to well over half in 2022. In  particular, orders related to SiC power electronics  devices more than tripled year-on-year, boosted from Q3 onwards by Aixtron’s new G10-SiC multi-wafer (9x6”  or 6x8”) CVD system — launched in mid-September — which already comprises the vast majority of SiC orders, having a strong  impact on overall growth.  Driven by the overall positive order development, equipment order backlog grew by 64% from €214.6m at the end of 2021 to €351.8m at the end of 2022. 
  Indicating  the higher levels of shipments that are expected to be made, advance payments received from customers have risen further, from €121.8m  at the end of Q3/2022 (almost a third of the order backlog) to €141m at the end  of Q4/2022 (about 40% of the order  backlog), almost doubling year-on-year from €77m at the end of 2021. Based on the budgeted exchange rate of $1.15/€ (versus $1.20/€ in 2022), for full-year 2023 Aixtron  expects over 9% year-on-year growth in order  intake to €600–680m. Based on the equipment order backlog (convertible into 2023  revenue) of about €300m as of 1 January,  joined by a forecasted €180–240m  in new order intake that should be convertible into revenue during 2023, plus a  forecasted €100m in after-sales revenue, Aixtron expects double-digit growth in  full-year revenue to €580–640m in 2023 (including  the shift of some units assembled in 2022 and shipped in 2023). The firm also  expects full-year gross margin  of about 45% and EBIT margin of 25–27% for 2023.
