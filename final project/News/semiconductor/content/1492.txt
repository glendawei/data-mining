BluGlass grows customer base with two additional purchase orders for commercial lasers BluGlass  Ltd of Silverwater, Australia – which manufactures gallium nitride (GaN)  blue laser diodes based on its proprietary low-temperature, low-hydrogen  remote-plasma chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology – says that it continues to grow its customer base,  receiving two additional purchase orders  for both its single-mode and multi-mode violet 405nm and blue 450nm GaN lasers  in flexible form factors. The orders are  from established organizations developing advanced quantum, energy and  industrial applications, and include a leading international energy research institution. Customers will use  BluGlass’ lasers for testing and qualification within their own applications. “We are quickly  gaining traction with our first GaN laser products, with strong interest from  customers across our product suite and target markets,” says CEO Jim Haden.  “These orders validate our go-to-market approach and reinforce the urgent need  for suppliers to address growing unmet needs in the industry,” he adds. “Our  lasers are being implemented by customers looking to develop and test  innovative new products across next-generation energy production, quantum, artificial intelligence (AI),  and advanced manufacturing. Our flexibility is seeing customers wanting to work  with us, and our first 450nm order in custom form factors is testament to  this.” Initial order  volumes are small and financially not material. However, once BluGlass’ lasers  have been qualified within the applications, they are expected to grow in  volume and frequency. Additional customer proposals are progressing across  multiple market segments.
