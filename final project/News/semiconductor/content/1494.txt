Opportunities for UK companies to collaborate with Taiwan CSA (Compound Semiconductor  Applications) Catapult is highlighting the collaboration opportunities open to  the UK compound semiconductor industry and Taiwan in a two-part online  seminar series ‘Seeking Value Beyond Semiconductor Industry: Opportunities and  Challenges for IC Design and Compound Semiconductor in the UK and  Taiwan’ on 14 and 16 March. Established in 2017 by UK Government agency  Innovate UK  (which provides funding and support for business innovation as part of UK  Research and Innovation), CSA Catapult is a not-for-profit organization focused  on accelerating the adoption of compound semiconductors for three key applications  (the road to Net Zero, future telecoms and intelligent sensing). It works  across the UK in a range of industry sectors from automotive to medical, and  from digital communications to aerospace. The Industrial Technology Research  Institute (ITRI) and the British Office Taipei (BOT) are hosting the webinars  to discuss potential areas and opportunities for UK and Taiwanese companies to  collaborate in the future. In 2020, CSA Catapult signed a  Memorandum of Understanding with Taiwan’s Industrial Technology  Research Institute (ITRI) to advance semiconductor research between the two  organizations. “On behalf of CSA Catapult, I will  be delivering a keynote focused on compound semiconductor development in  the UK during the Opportunities and Challenges for Compound Semiconductor  webinar,” says CSA Catapult’s strategic development director Dr Andy  Sellars. “These webinars are a great opportunity for companies who are  interested in collaborating with partners overseas, and I recommend anyone  interested in a potential partnership or looking for more information to  attend,” he adds. The webinars on the 14 and 16 March  are focus on two themes: To register for the two-part online  seminar series, click here
