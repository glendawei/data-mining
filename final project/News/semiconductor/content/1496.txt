Keysight introduces new method to accelerate power amplifier digital pre-distortion test speeds Keysight Technologies Inc  of Santa Rosa, CA, USA has  introduced the new Iterative Learning Control (ILC) test method that  significantly shortens digital pre-distortion (DPD) test times for  power amplifiers. As a core component in wireless communication devices,  characterization of power amplifiers (PAs) is a critical but  time-consuming task that can take hours or even days during the R&D phase.  By shortening the time it takes to complete the design and validation process,  power amplifier manufacturers are able to accelerate their time-to-market. The ILC test method shortens DPD test time to minutes and  accelerates R&D time from test validation to product design and  optimization. As a part of Keysight’s comprehensive High Frequency  Measurement Solution portfolio, the ILC test method runs on the N9055EM0E  Power Amplifier Measurement Application and uses the VXG Vector  Signal Generator and PXA Signal Analyzer to provide what is claimed  to be industry-leading test performance for signal generation and analysis. The ILC DPD test method offers the following benefits: Taiwan-based fabless semiconductor manufacturer Hexawave (an  Ennostar Group affiliate) is first to deploy the ILC test method to  characterize its new HWA1330 5G gallium arsenide (GaAs) PA up to 4W in the  3.3–3.8GHz frequency range. The ILC test method was critical in validating that  the HWA1330 can meet design targets including more than 30% power-added  efficiency (PAE), 35.5dB power gain, and below –50dBc adjacent-channel  leakage ratio (ACLR) at 100MHz bandwidth and 8.5dB peak-to-average power ratio  (PAPR) with DPD. “Keysight’s innovative test method allows us to rapidly and  reliably validate our 5G new radio (NR) power amplifier designs,”  comments Hexawave’s president Dr Mong Lin.
