CSconnected welcomes UK Government Science & Technology Framework, but environment needed for exploitation and commercialization of innovations The UK Government’s newly created Department for Science,  Innovation & Technology (DSIT) has published its new Science and Technology  framework that clearly identifies semiconductors and quantum technologies as  two of the five technologies that are critical to the UK. Introducing the framework, the Right Honorable Michelle  Donelan MP, Secretary of State at DSIT, noted that “Britain has a long  history of leadership and innovation” and that “investment in science and technology  is more important than ever.” The UK is home to the world’s first compound semiconductor  (CS) cluster. Representing the South Wales-based technology cluster and  based in Cardiff,  CSconnected says that it welcomes the recognition of the importance of  semiconductors and quantum as critical enabling technologies. “Sadly, the UK’s  enviable reputation for developing technological innovations has too often not  been matched by an environment that encourages exploitation and commercialization  of those innovations,” comments CSconnected’s  director Chris Meadows. “We look forward to  the publication of the UK strategies for semiconductors and quantum  technologies that we expect to help support the creation of conditions for  establishing the UK as a clear global leader in next generation technologies.” The UK strategies for semiconductors and quantum technologies are  expected to be issued in early 2023.
