Lawrence Livermore chooses SemiQ’s silicon carbide diodes for particle accelerator project SemiQ Inc  of Lake Forest, CA, USA – which designs, develops and manufactures silicon carbide  (SiC) power semiconductors  and 150mm SiC epitaxial wafers for  high-frequency, high-temperature and high-efficiency power semiconductor  devices – says that Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory (LLNL) has chosen it to supply SiC diodes for an ongoing  particle accelerator project. SemiQ developed  its top-side solderable 1200V 10A silicon carbide  diode in a SMC (surface-mount component)  package to withstand continuous high-current-pulse operation at 15 times rated current. The diodes are used as a snubber  circuit and energy discharge  circuit; with 60 devices in parallel on a single pulser board with high packing density. The accelerator  will enable x-ray images that can be used to certify the safety, security and  effectiveness of modernized nuclear warheads without nuclear testing.
