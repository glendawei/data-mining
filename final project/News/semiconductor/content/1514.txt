POET and Vanguard Automation collaborate on solutions for co-packaged optics and AI–ML applications POET Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada — designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer and  photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the data-center, telecom and  artificial intelligence (AI) markets — and Vanguard Automation GmbH  of Karlsruhe,  Germany (the developer of  3D-nanoprinted Photonic Wire Bond and Micro-Lens technology and  manufacturer of software-defined equipment for photonic integration and  packaging) are collaborating to enable the integration of micro-lenses on the  POET Optical Interposer to maximize coupling efficiency while maintaining  POET’s wafer-level passive assembly process. “The number-one requirement for the POET Optical Interposer  is to maintain a passive, wafer-level assembly process for POET-designed  optical engines and light source products. It is the key to our  ability to offer significant scale and cost benefits to our customers,” says  POET’s chairman & CEO Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “Our  Optical Interposer, together with Vanguard Automation’s Facet-Attached-Micro-Lenses,  creates a powerful platform for electro-optical engines for transceivers,  co-packaged optics, light engines and sensing devices. Incorporating  micro-lenses improves the coupling efficiency of light as it passes from one  photonic device to another, which in turn reduces power consumption of the  combined solution. The precise alignment and printing of the micro-lenses at  wafer level offers significant scalability and enhances our ability to  address new markets with a uniquely powerful solution,” he adds. “The ability to print Facet-Attached-Micro-Lenses at  wafer level with POET’s Optical Interposer technology offers a unique  electro-optical platform and combines the complementary strengths of both  companies,” says Vanguard Automation’s CEO & managing director  Thorsten Mayer. POET and Vanguard will initially collaborate to integrate the  micro-lenses on POET’s LightBar products, aimed at AI–ML  accelerators and bio-sensing applications to validate power efficiency  improvements and the viability of chip-scale, wafer-level manufacturing using  micro-lenses. POET expects to start sampling LightBar products incorporating  Vanguard Automation’s micro-lenses to customers in second-half 2023.
