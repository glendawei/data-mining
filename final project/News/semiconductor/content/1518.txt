Vector Photonics commercializing uncooled 1W, 1310nm CW PCSEL for cloud data centers Vector Photonics Ltd (which was spun off  from Scotland’s University of Glasgow in 2020, based on research led by  professor Richard Hogg) is to begin  commercialization of an uncooled, 1W, 1310nm continuous-wave (CW) photonic-crystal  surface-emitting laser (PCSEL), targeted at interconnects, silicon photonics and co-packaged optics (CPO) in next-generation cloud  data-center applications. A 1W laser is said to offer significant increases in optical power over incumbent distributed feedback  (DFB) technology, with manufacturing and energy-saving benefits. The 1W laser  leverages Vector Photonics’ existing PCSEL commercialization work. “An uncooled 1W PCSEL is a game-changer for cloud datacoms  applications,” believes chief technology officer  Dr Richard Taylor. “Currently,  next-generation data-center interconnects must deliver 800Gbps, increasing to  1.6Tbps and then 3.2Tbps over the next decade. The 1W PCSEL enables this  development, with a significant reduction in the quantity of lasers required  over DFB technology. The interconnects, silicon photonics  chips and CPO systems, where they are used, become significantly easier to  make, with the likelihood of improved yield and reliability. In addition, the  1W PCSEL has a symmetrical far-field, which requires less operational power to  achieve the necessary performance,” he adds. “The full impact of a 1W PCSEL is yet to be quantified,” Taylor  continues. “However, these high-power lasers will change the entire  architecture of datacoms chips and systems. Further, significant benefits  include reduced power consumption,  heat, latency and manufacturing costs.”
