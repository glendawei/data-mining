CGD presents GaN-based power electronics at APEC At the Applied Power Electronics  Conference (APEC 2023) in Orlando, FL, USA (19–23 March), Cambridge GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) — which was spun out of the University of  Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Electrical Power  and Energy Conversion group in 2016  by CEO Dr Giorgia Longobardi and  professor Florin Udrea and designs, develops and commercializes power transistors and ICs that use  GaN-on-silicon substrates — is presenting several papers covering strategic  views on sustainability and deep-dive technology analysis. Executives from the  firm are chairing two sessions, and on booth 305  CGD is presenting demos using proven reference designs  and evaluation boards plus new and  established GaN eco-system partnerships. “The power electronics community and the wider world are now  accepting that gallium nitride  technology can play a huge role in enabling sustainable electronics solutions  that are more efficient, have high performance and are more compact,” says Longobardi.  “At important international events such as APEC, we have an opportunity to  explain and demonstrate our technology to an audience drawn from many different  industries and markets.” At APEC, CGD is presenting four papers: 
21 March 23 March Also on 23 March, Peter DiMaso, VP business development Americas, is chairing session  IS19 on WBG applications at 8.30am (EST), and Peter Comiskey, director of  applications engineering, is  chairing session IS25 on Wide-Bandgap  (WBG) devices at 1.45pm (EST). In booth 305, CGD is  presenting a range of demos designed to showcase what is claimed to be the  industry’s first easy-to-use and scalable 650V GaN HEMT family. ICeGaN H1 single-chip eMode HEMTs can be driven  like a MOSFET, without the need for special gate drivers,  complex and lossy driving circuits,  negative voltage supply requirements or additional clamping components. The  displays include half-bridge, 350W LLC,  350W PFC, 65W QRF and 3kW LLC  evaluation circuits, plus a thermal demo and an example of a 3kV photovoltaic  solar inverter developed using GaN in partnership with Neways.
