Transphorm presenting at APEC 2023 Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near Santa Barbara,  CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride  (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion  — says that it is  highlighting its broad spectrum (low- to high-power) GaN power conversion solutions in booth 853 at the 38th annual Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC 2023)  in Orlando, FL, USA (19–23 March), where the firm is a Silver Partner. Specifically, the firm is showcasing the recently announced  WT7162RHUG24A device, the new SuperGaN system-in-package (SiP) developed with  Weltrend Semiconductor Inc of Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan designed to round out its FET  portfolio. Transphorm says that this device will provide another opportunity to  easily and quickly design in its high-performance GaN platform while reducing bill-of-materials  (BOM) component count and overall  system cost. Transphorm is also showcasing new in-production products from  top-tier global brand customers representing various markets. APEC attendees  will also learn about drop-in and replacement solutions for existing GaN power  applications. Transphorm claims to support the largest range of power conversion requirements (45W to 10+kW)  across the widest range of power applications. Its FET portfolio includes 650V  and 900V devices, with 1200V devices in development. Since they are JEDEC and  AEC-Q101 qualified, they are optimal solutions for power adapters and computer power supply units (PSUs) through to  broad industrial uninterruptible  power supplies (UPSs) and electric vehicle  (EV) mobility systems. The mix of customer products being displayed at APEC  underscores the broad usability of the SuperGaN platform, says Transphorm. At APEC, Transphorm experts are delivering the following  presentations:
