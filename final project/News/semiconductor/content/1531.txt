Crystal IS and Asahi Kasei announce lifetime characterization data for Klaran LA UVC LED Tokyo-based Asahi Kasei  and its subsidiary Crystal IS Inc of Green Island, NY, USA,  which makes proprietary ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UVC LEDs), have released  lifetime characterization data after more than 10,000 hours of  testing its Klaran LA UVC LED, which supports a projected L70 lifetime of 25,000 hours.  This advancement retains true disinfection with a refined wavelength optimal  for germicidal efficiency, with a lifetime exceeding that of low-pressure  mercury lamp technology, promoting the transition to non-mercury/non-ozone  generating devices.  The characterization data on its Klaran LA UVC LEDs was released  to assist partner companies in water, air and surface treatment to take full  advantage of its UVC LED  capabilities in their designs. This data shows how a set of Klaran LA LEDs operating at a current of 350mA  and with a junction temperature of 53°C (soldering point temperature of 35°C -  Figure A) would have a projected L70 lifetime value over 25,000 hours (L70 refers to the point in time  when an LED produces 70% of its initial light output). This data was observed  on the Crystal IS in-house VEKTREX  Integrated Thermal Control Systems (Figure B),  demonstrating the organization’s commitment to providing ample characterization  data under various test conditions to aid in customers’ designs. The VEKTREX system  enables Crystal IS to perform  lifetime testing of large quantities of LEDs at multiple temperatures and  driving currents. “Klaran LA's lifetime  performance is the result of Asahi Kasei  product innovation using the Crystal IS  proprietary aluminium nitride  substrate and reinforces the company mission to replace low-pressure mercury  lamps in consumer and industrial applications that depend on reliable and  effective disinfection performance,” says Crystal IS’  president & CEO Eoin Connolly. “Our rigorous testing on thousands of Klaran  devices and ISO 9001 quality system  provide the data-driven proof of the reliability and performance of our Klaran  products,” he adds. The Klaran product line leverages the unique properties of Crystal IS aluminium nitride  to provide premium germicidal UVC LEDs  and associated modules to treat water, air and surfaces for healthcare,  consumer appliances, and commercial water treatment.
