Mitsubishi Electric develops 200Gbps (112Gbaud PAM4) EML chip supporting four CWDM signals Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Electric Corp has developed a 200Gbps  (112Gbaud four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM4))  electro-absorption modulator laser diode (EML) chip that doubles the  speed of the firm’s existing 100Gbps EML chip due to a proprietary hybrid  waveguide structure. Support for coarse wavelength division multiplexing  (CWDM) of four wavelengths realizes 800Gbps transmission using four chips or  1.6Tbps using eight chips. Improved operational speed (up to 200Gbps), high extinction ratio and high optical output power are  achieved due to Mitsubishi Electric’s unique hybrid waveguide structure, which  combines a buried heterostructure laser diode for high optical-output  power and a high-mesa waveguide electro-absorption modulator. The greatly improved performance is expected to raise the  transmission speed of optical transceivers used in data centers to respond  to mushrooming data-traffic demand due to the rapid growth of video  distribution services and cloud computing. Mitsubishi Electric is presenting its new chip at the  Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC 2023) in  San Diego, CA, USA (5-9 March).
