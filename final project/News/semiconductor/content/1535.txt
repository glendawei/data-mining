Porotech opens new UK and Taiwan facilities Porotech (a spin off from  the Cambridge Centre for Gallium Nitride at the UK’s University of  Cambridge that has developed porous GaN material) has celebrated the opening of new facilities  in Cambridge, UK on 16 February and  in Hsinchu, Taiwan on 20 February  with an evening for industry professionals, university professors and local  government representatives to discuss the future of the firm and its technology. Porotech says that its new  DynamicPixelTuning (DPT) technology can produce substantial gains in  resolution, brightness and efficiency for every type of display while  overcoming roadblocks in the commercial viability of micro-LED displays. At the UK event Warren East, former CEO of  Rolls Royce Holdings, delivered an  opening speech before joining Porotech’s co-founder  & CEO Dr Tongtong Zhu in the  official ribbon-cutting ceremony. “Porotech has some fundamental building blocks here to be hugely successful,”  commented East.  “Its innovation, the application of their hard work, and their ability to  remain agile in how they approach the market and their customers means all the  more likely that something impressive will spring out of this building.” Guests were invited to tour the new  facilities and observe demonstrations of the technology in action, including  display screens, augmented-reality (AR) glasses and transparent displays. “We are not focused on a particular  market, we are looking beyond that,” commented VP & head of Taiwan Dr Kunal Kashyap during the Taiwan  event.
