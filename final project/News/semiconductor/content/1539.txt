Gallium Semiconductor releases nonlinear model library for GaN product portfolio Singapore-based Gallium Semiconductor, which  designs and manufactures RF gallium nitride (GaN) solutions for 5G mobile  communications, aerospace & defense, and industrial, scientific &  medical (ISM) applications,  has released a library of nonlinear models for its portfolio of GaN products.  The library consists of 22 models covering all of Gallium Semi’s broadband dual  flat no-leads (DFN) plastic and air-cavity ceramic (ACC) packaged products. All  models are designed and validated with broadband S-parameters and load-pull  measurements to cover a broad range of applications. “It’s critical for our customers to accurately simulate  performance of our components in their system designs to achieve first-pass  success,” says Michael Guyonnet, VP of networks. “The release of our  comprehensive library of nonlinear models underscores our commitment to  delivering exceptional and seamless customer service from design-in to  production.” The library is available for both Cadence AWR Design Environment  and Keysight PathWave Advanced Design  System (ADS) software. The library is available free of charge for qualified  customers.
