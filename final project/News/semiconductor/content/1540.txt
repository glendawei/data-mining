Sivers Photonics to demo CW-WDM MSA-compliant DFB laser arrays at OFC IC and integrated module supplier  Sivers Semiconductors AB of Kista, Sweden says that its subsidiary Sivers Photonics of Glasgow, Scotland, UK is to exhibit and give a live demonstration of its CW-WDM MSA-compliant 8-wavelength  O-band DFB  laser arrays on 7–9 March in booth #5400 at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC 2023) in San Diego, CA, USA. Sivers says that the  laser technology is enabling integrated photonics to support the growing demand  for improved internet services at lower power consumption and reduced costs. Following a  successful demo at last September’s European  Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC 2022), Sivers Photonics is once again partnering with silicon photonics-based chip-to-chip  optical connectivity firm Ayar Labs of Santa Clara, CA, USA (which  is exhibiting in booth #6008), demonstrating the 8-wavelength DFB laser  array integrated into Ayar Labs’ SuperNova multi-wavelength optical source. This  technology is driving advanced ultra-high-speed optical interconnects for use  in next-generation applications, including co-packaged optics (CPO),  high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). “This ongoing  partnership is crucial for driving  leading-edge, ultra-high-speed optical  interconnect solutions for next-generation applications,” says Sivers Photonics’ managing director Billy McLaughlin. “Demonstrating  our 8-wavelength  DFB laser  arrays at OFC allows us  to showcase  how far  we have  come with our DFB technology,”  says Sivers  Semiconductors’ group CEO Anders Storm. “Our indium phosphide (InP)  lasers are showing world-class performance, underpinned by our great  partner Ayar Labs using our  DFBs to show their one-of-a-  kind solution with their SuperNova  light source in combination with the TeraPHY optical I/O chiplet,” he adds. Sivers is also  showcasing the ongoing work with its partners imec and ASMPT on high-precision  III-V laser flip-chip assembly for silicon photonics. Flip-chip-bonded DFB lasers/RSOAs  from Sivers’ InP100 product platform, with precision bonding from partner  ASMPT, allow imec to extend the capability of its iSiPP silicon photonics  platform with validated interfaces for hybrid laser integration, accelerating  the adoption of silicon photonics at scale.
