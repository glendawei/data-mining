MACOM to demo 100G/lane optical link with linear drive interface at OFC MACOM Technology Solutions Inc of Lowell,  MA, USA (which designs and manufactures  semiconductors, components and subassemblies for  analog RF, microwave, millimeter-wave and photonic applications) is  demonstrating its linear drive  100Gbps per lane optical links at the Optical Networking and  Communications Conference (OFC 2023)  in San Diego, CA, USA (5–9 March). The live demonstration of the optical link, using MACOM PURE DRIVE trans-impedance amplifiers (TIAs)  and laser drivers and Broadcom’s  Tomahawk 5 switch chip, is taking place in MACOM’s booth  #3927 and Broadcom’s booth #6425. A linear drive architecture eliminates the digital signal  processor (DSP) from pluggable optical modules while lowering power consumption, improving signal latency and  reducing cost. With a linear drive  link, the switch ASIC consolidates the digital signal processing while linear  laser drivers and linear TIAs  provide the compensation required for electro-optic conversion. This  interoperability demonstration by Broadcom and MACOM leverages Broadcom’s  Tomahawk 5 switch ASIC and MACOM  PURE DRIVE laser drivers and TIAs. “The MACOM PURE DRIVE  chipset is specifically designed to provide leading high-performance linear  compensation, enabling the linear drive  architecture,” says Ryan Latchman, VP, High-Performance Connectivity product marketing. “The optical networking industry has had a long tradition of  optimizing interconnect to reduce latency, power and cost in order to service  global needs,” says Peter Del Vecchio,  data-center switch product manager,  Core Switching Group, Broadcom. “This optimization becomes increasingly  important for AI/ML clusters. Our collaboration with MACOM represents an  important step in realizing this optimization at 100G/lane leveraging the  Tomahawk 5 SerDes capability.”
