Silicon Ranch commits to extra 1.5GW of First Solar’s PV modules Silicon Ranch of Nashville, TN, one  of the USA’s largest independent power producers, has procured an  additional 1.5GW of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules  from First Solar Inc. The Series 6 Plus modules were  designed and developed at First Solar’s R&D facilities in California  and Ohio, and in the USA are manufactured in Ohio. The deal expands on a master supply agreement that includes a 4GW  transaction announced in April 2022 and, more recently, a 700MW commitment  announced in October. Whereas the prior agreements will supply Silicon Ranch  projects through 2025, this latest expansion will serve projects in 2026 and  2027. Over the past year, Silicon Ranch has committed to support  domestic manufacturing and to lower the carbon impact of production through  significant agreements with First Solar and Nextracker. The expanded  partnership with First Solar enables Silicon Ranch to continue  sourcing US solar technology from a manufacturer with facilities across the  country. First Solar recently announced plans to build its fourth US  module manufacturing facility in Alabama, further bolstering the domestic solar  supply chain in the south-eastern United States, a region in which  Silicon Ranch pioneered utility-scale solar development with the first  large-scale solar projects in Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas and  Kentucky. “Silicon Ranch is a trusted partner that shares our position on  supporting the domestic economy, and this expansion of our partnership supports  the accelerated deployment of Responsible Solar in America,” says First Solar’s chief commercial officer Georges Antoun. Silicon Ranch currently owns, operates and maintains more than 150  solar generating facilities in 15 states, from New York to California.  Earlier this year, the firm announced that it had conducted a $600m equity  raise.
