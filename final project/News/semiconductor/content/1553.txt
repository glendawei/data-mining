EPC launches reference design for high-power-density, low-profile DC-DC converters Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of ElSegundo,  CA, USA – which makes enhancement-mode galliumnitride on silicon (eGaN)  power field-effect transistors (FETs) and integratedcircuits for  powermanagement applications – has announced the availability of the EPC9177,  a digitally controlled, single-output synchronous buckconverter referencedesign  board operating at 720kHz switchingfrequency  converting an input voltage of 48V, 36V, 28V to a regulated 12V output voltage  and delivering up to 20A continuous outputcurrent. The small-area (21mm x 13mm), low-profile (3mm-height inductor),  synchronous buckconverter features  the EPC23102 fullyintegrated  half-bridge ePowerStage and is  optimized for computing powersupplies  and USBPD3.1 multi-port chargers and on-board DC-DC solutions able  to convert a 28V–48V input to a 12V or 20V output. With the advent of USBPD3.1, the output voltage for USB charging  increases from 20V to 48V and the power increases from 100W up to 240W. This  higher power enables USB charging beyond laptop and cell-phone fastcharging to higher-power applications including gamingPCs,  powertools, and e-bikes. While the  main output of the chargers is 48V to allow the higher outputpower with 5A-rated cables, multi-port  chargers can also support lower outputvoltages  such as 5V, 12V and 20V to be compatible with a wider range of devices. A smart  DC-DC regulator is required to generate these lower voltages. Additionally, a  DC-DC regulator will be required resident on the motherboard of the gamingPC or powertools  to convert the 48V to 20V and 12V input.
