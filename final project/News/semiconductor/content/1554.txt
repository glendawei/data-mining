Navitas’ Q4 revenue up 68% year-on-year, boosted by acquisitions Diversification of Technology, End Markets and Geography Positions  Navitas for Scale For fourth-quarter  2022, gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and  silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance,  CA, USA has reported revenue of $12.3m, up 21% on $10.2m last quarter and 68% on  $7.3m a year ago. Full-year revenue grew by 60%, from $23.7m in 2021 to $37.9m  in 2022. However, this takes into account revenue from silicon carbide  (SiC) power semiconductor device designer and manufacturer GeneSiC  Semiconductor Inc of Dulles, VA, USA (acquired in mid-August). On a non-GAAP basis, full-year  gross margin has fallen from 45.4% in 2021 to 40.8% for 2022. Quarterly gross  margin is down on 44.3% a year ago to 40.6% in Q4/2022. However, this is up  from 38.4% last quarter, and exceeds the forecasted  40%. Quarterly operating expenses  have grown further, from $10.1m a year ago and $14.2m last quarter to $17m. This increased full-year OpEx from $35.3m in 2021  to $56.2m for 2022. Quarterly net loss has  risen further, from $7m a year ago and $9.5m last quarter to $9.7m  in Q42022. Full-year net loss hence grew from $24.8m to $37.6m. “2022 was a pivotal  year for Navitas as we expanded beyond the mobile market into additional  high-growth markets on a global scale,” says CEO & co-founder Gene Sheridan.  “We completed three strategic transactions adding SiC, digital isolators [Belgium-based VDD Tech, acquired in last July] and Si analog  controllers [Halo Microelectronics, acquired from a joint venture partner this January] to enable power  management solutions across a broad range of next-generation, electrified  applications,” he adds. Customer/product highlights in 2022 are listed as:  For first-quarter  2023, Navitas expects revenue to be roughly flat on a sequential basis but up  85% year-on-year. Gross margin is also expected to be relatively flat sequentially,  but to expand incrementally throughout 2023. Operating expenses should be about  $18m in Q1, then grow throughout the year, albeit declining as percentage of  revenue while the business scales. “In 2023, we are well  positioned for strong growth in all of our target markets including EV,  solar/storage, appliance/industrial and mobile/consumer,” reckons Sheridan.
