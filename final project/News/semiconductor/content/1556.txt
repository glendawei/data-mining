Indium arsenide quantum dot lasers on silicon with simple GaAs buffer Researchers in China have fabricated  monolithic indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dot(QD) lasers on silicon (Si) without using  dislocation filter layers of strained-layer superlattices (SLSs) in the gallium arsenide (GaAs) buffer [Yongli Wang et al, Optics Express,v31, p4862, 2023]. The team from Institute of Semiconductors,  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Beijing University of Posts and  Telecommunications, comments: “This simple structure avoids the injection of  current through the SLSs interface and the cross-hatching introduced by the  SLSs. Moreover, the whole process can be further simplified, which is expected  to promote the application of photonic integrated circuits.” The purpose of dislocation filters, and  other complex techniques is to avoid defects that sap laser performance such as  antiphase boundaries (APBs) and threading dislocations, which arise through the  differences in the charge polarities of the chemicals bonds, and the large lattice  mismatch, between silicon and GaAs. The researchers add: “As the device has GaAs-only  growth and has a buffer as thin as ~2.5μm,  the compatibility of the device with the industry-standard fabrication process  has also improved.” The team sees their approach as providing  “an innovative way to prepare low-cost, CMOS-compatible silicon-based light  sources, which is conducive to promoting the commercial development of silicon photonic interconnects.”
