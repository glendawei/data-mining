Transphorm’s product revenue grows 25% in December quarter For fiscal third-quarter 2023 (to end-December 2022), Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near  Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and  AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors  (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion — has reported revenue of  $4.5m, down slightly on $4.6m a year ago but up 22% on last quarter’s $3.67m  (exceeding the prior 20% quarterly growth rate). Product revenue was up 25%  sequentially and 9% year-on-year, reflecting another strong quarter from  ramping shipments of GaN products for a broad range of power conversion  applications. “This quarter saw solid execution and higher-than-expected revenues,  with our product revenues being driven by strong traction in the higher-power  space,” notes chief financial officer Cameron McAulay. 
  Highlights are listed as: “Our business momentum is exemplified by another strong quarter of  design wins as we aggressively pursued and won numerous additional designs-in  both high-power and low-power markets, including world-wide tier-1 leaders like  HP,” says president, COO & co-founder Primit Parikh. “We look forward to  building on our success in this segment of the adapter market, while further  growing our leadership in high power, which comprised more than 70% of  our revenue in the quarter [up from 65% last quarter],” he adds. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses have risen further, from $4.4m a  year ago and $5.1m last quarter to $5.9m. Net loss has risen from $4.3m ($0.09 per share) a year ago and $5.1m  ($0.09 per share) last quarter to $9.1m ($0.16 per share). However, this  includes a one-time write-off of $2.8m ($0.05 per share) for epiwafer inventory  resulting largely from the process of bringing up the firm’s Japan epitaxial  reactors over the last several quarters. During the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash fell from  $34m to $23.6m. “As we enter calendar year 2023, the company is well positioned and  remains keenly focused on achieving continued short-term momentum and long-term  growth, driven by a robust pipeline,” says chief financial officer Cameron  McAulay. “While we still face near term macro-headwinds, we remain  well-positioned to translate the above momentum to business growth in fiscal  2024,” reckons Parikh. “We also made solid progress on our plans to ramp up  additional capacity over the coming year, in order to be prepared and ready to  meet the significant demand that lies ahead.”
