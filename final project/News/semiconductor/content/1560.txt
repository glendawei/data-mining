Coherent introduces 1300nm high-power DFB lasers for silicon photonics-based transceivers Materials, networking and laser technology firm  Coherent Corp of  Saxonburg, PA, USA has introduced its 1300nm high-power continuous wave  (CW) distributed feedback (DFB) laser diodes for silicon photonics-based  datacom pluggable transceivers. Cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) service providers are ramping up deployments of 400G and  800G transceivers for their megascale data-center buildouts, with an eye on  1.6T transceivers in the future. Coherent is introducing high-power CW DFB  laser diodes that enable 400G to 1.6T silicon photonics-based  transceivers, which are among the transceiver technology platforms deployed in  the data-center mid-reach range of 500m to 2km. “Coherent continues to advance the state of the art  in indium phosphide semiconductor laser technology that will enable the cloud  to continue to rapidly and sustainably scale capacity,” says Dr Kou-Wei Wang,  VP & general manager, Indium Phosphide & Integrated Circuits  business unit. “While our new lasers are ideally suited for today’s  high-speed silicon photonics-based pluggable transceivers, including our  own designs, they are also perfect for future co-packaged optics applications.” The new lasers achieve 100mW of output power when uncooled and  300mW of output power when cooled, to enable 100Gbps and 200Gbps per lane,  respectively, for DR4 and DR8 transceivers. They are available in four coarse wavelength  division multiplexing (CWDM) wavelengths for FR4 transceivers. Coherent is exhibiting in booth #3815 at the Optical Fiber  Communication conference (OFC 2023)  in San Diego, CA, USA (7–9 March),  showcasing its new products and technology for next-generation optical  communications networks and sensing.
