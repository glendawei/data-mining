BluGlass secures first customer purchase orders for 405nm and 420nm commercial lasers BluGlass Ltd of Silverwater, Australia – which  has developed proprietary low-temperature, low-hydrogen remote-plasma chemical  vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology – says that it has secured initial purchase orders for  its 405nm and 420nm 250mW single-mode gallium nitride  (GaN) lasers from two customers. These commercial purchase orders were received from what are  described as industry-leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) following  BluGlass’ product launch at the SPIE Photonics West  2023 conference in San Francisco, CA, USA (28 January  to 2 February). The customers will use these first products to qualify BluGlass’  lasers within their own applications, which include quantum and robotic uses.  Revenues from these initial low-volume orders are immaterial but, after the  lasers are qualified, BluGlass expects to secure recurring larger-volume orders  from these customers. Also, additional proposals are progressing with several  customers across multiple market segments. “Our newly launched GaN lasers were incredibly well received at  Photonics West, reaffirming the need for a dedicated provider to address unmet  market needs across several verticals,” says president Jim Haden. “We are  encouraged to have received our first orders so soon after the event. These  orders are an important step towards commercial revenues and demonstrate demand  for our lasers from key industry players in under-served wavelengths, flexible  form factors, and semi-custom  designs,” he adds. “As a result of this increased interest in our newly  released products, we expect additional orders from potential customers and  partners to be imminent.”
