Veeco grows revenue 11% in 2022, despite 10.5% dip in Q4 driven by smartphone-related 5G RF weakness For fourth-quarter 2022, epitaxial  deposition and process equipment maker Veeco Instruments Inc of Plainview, NY, USA has reported revenue  of $153.8m, down 10.5% on $171. 9m last quarter but roughly level with $153m a  year ago. The Semiconductor segment (Front-End and Back-End, as well as EUV Mask Blank systems and  Advanced Packaging) contributed $94m (61% of total revenue), down from $100m last  quarter but up sharply on $65.4m (43% of revenue) a year ago, led by multiple laser spike anneal (LSA) systems for both leading- and  trailing-edge nodes, as well as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and advanced packaging (AP) lithography  systems. The Compound Semiconductor segment (Power Electronics, RF  Filter & Device applications, and Photonics including specialty, mini- and  micro-LEDs, VCSELs, Laser Diodes) contributed $25m (16% of total revenue), down on $28m last  quarter and $34.7m (23% of total revenue) a year ago. The Data Storage segment (equipment for thin-film magnetic head  manufacturing) contributed $17m (11% of total revenue), down on $28m last  quarter and $36.5m (24% of total revenue) a year ago. The Scientific &  Other segment (research institutions and other applications) contributed $18m  (12% of total revenue), up on $16m last quarter and $16.3m (10% of total  revenue) a year ago.  By region, the  Asia-Pacific region (excluding China) comprised 42% of revenue (up on 26% a  year ago) driven by Semiconductor system sales; the USA 25% (down on 37%);  China 19% (down on 25%) mainly Semiconductor systems for trailing-edge nodes; and Europe,  Middle-East & Africa (EMEA) 14% (up on 12% a year ago); with the rest of  the world remaining less than 1%. For full-year 2022, revenue  grew by 11% from $583.3m in 2021 to $646.1m for 2022.

  Semiconductor contributed a record $369m (57% of total revenue),  up 50% on 2021’s $247.1m (43% of revenue), led by increased traction in both  leading- and trailing-node laser annealing systems. Compound Semiconductor  contributed $121m (19% of total revenue), up 13% on 2021’s $107m, driven by  systems for photonics applications. Data Storage  contributed just $88m (13% of total revenue), almost halving from 2021’s  $168.8m (29% of total revenue), as hard-disk-drive customers slowed their pace  of capacity additions for magnetic head manufacturing. Scientific &  Other (research institutions and other applications) contributed $68m (11% of  total revenue), up 12% on 2021’s $60.5m.  By region, the  Asia-Pacific (excluding China) comprised 36% of revenue driven by semiconductor  customers; the USA 31% (down from 38%) mainly semiconductor and data-storage  customers; EMEA 14% (up from 9); and China 19%; with the rest of the world  remaining less than 1%. On a non-GAAP basis,  full-year gross margin has fallen slightly from 42% in 2021 to 41.9% for 2022. However,  despite being down slightly on 42.4% a year ago, Q4/2022 gross margin of 42.3% was up  on 42% last quarter, and exceeded guidance due to a more favorable product mix and lower manufacturing  and service costs. Operating expenses  were $41.3m, up from $40m a year ago but cut from $43.9m last quarter and lower  than the guidance range due to favorable selling, general & administrative  (SG&A) expenses. Full-year operating expenses rose from $158.5m in 2021 to $171.2m  for 2022, reflecting the R&D investments made in the Semiconductor and  Compound Semiconductor segments to execute the firm’s growth strategy. However,  as a percentage of revenue, OpEx has fallen from 27% to 26.5%,  providing operating leverage to the company. Quarterly net income  was $21.9m ($0.38 per diluted share), down from $26m ($0.45 per diluted  share) last quarter and $22.6m ($0.43 per diluted share) a year ago. Despite  Q4, full-year net income has grown from $73.6m ($1.43 per diluted share) in  2021 to $89.6m ($1.57 per diluted share) for 2022. Cash flow from operations was $33m in Q4 (almost doubling from  $17m a year ago), contributing to $108m for full-year 2022 (up 60%  year-on-year). CapEx has reduced further, from $9.2m a year ago (which included  $8m used for the build-out of the new facility in San Jose, CA, adding  much needed Semiconductor capacity) and $6m last quarter to just $3m, bringing  full-year CapEx to $25m. During  the quarter, cash and short-term investments hence rose further, by $31m, from $272m  to $303m (up from $225m a year ago). As of the end of Q4, Veeco was cash  debt positive. Long-term debt was  $275m, representing the carrying value of the $278m of convertible notes. Annual  cash interest expense was reduced to $10m in 2022. In January 2023, $20m  of the outstanding 2.7% convertible senior notes matured and  were fully settled by payment and cash, reducing total convertible debt to  $258m. “We entered 2022 with  supply chain challenges and strong demand. By the end of the year, the supply chain challenges  persisted, while demand became more mixed, due to softness in consumer markets  such as smartphones and PCs, and a weakening macro-economic environment in  general,” notes CEO Bill Miller Ph.D. “In the current  weaker demand environment, customers across certain segments of our business  have lowered fab utilization to address elevated levels of inventory,” says  chief financial officer John Kiernan. “In  some cases, they’ve taken steps to reduce both capital and operating expenses,  including spare parts and service. For first-quarter  2023, Veeco hence expects revenue to fall to $130–150m. Due to a less favorable product mix and lower volume,  gross margin should fall slightly to 39–41%. With operating expenses of $42–44m, net income is  expected to fall to $6–15m ($0.12–0.28 per diluted  share). However, aided by record  Semiconductor orders in both Q4/2022 and full-year 2022, total orders exceeded  revenue throughout 2022, yielding a positive book-to-bill ratio. Specifically,  in second-half 2022, Veeco saw an accelerated booking rate for trailing-node  semiconductor systems in China. For full-year 2022, China comprised about 27%  of total orders, compared with just 19% of revenue (so China revenue is expected  to rise as a percentage of total revenue in first-half 2023). Order backlog  hence grew by $60m through 2022, from $440m to $500m. “We enter the year  cautiously optimistic given our backlog position, coupled with the mixed demand  environment within which we’re operating,” says Miller. “We expect to  outperform the wafer fab equipment market [forecasted to be down 20% or more in  2023] with our Semiconductor products [flat to slightly up], grow in the data-storage  market and maintain profitability during the current macroeconomic challenges.” 
  Based on current  visibility supported by order backlog, Veeco’s revenue outlook for full-year  2023 remains relatively flat on 2022 at $630–670m, with revenue in the second half  exceeding that of the first half, based on the scheduled shipments of order  backlog. The firm continues to target diluted earnings per share of $1.15–1.35. “With weakness in  consumer end-markets, our Wet Processing business has been  experiencing a slowdown. However, the compound semiconductor  end-market we’re working to penetrate with MOCVD such as GaN power electronics and  micro-LED show promising signs of growth over the long-term,” says Miller.  “We’re committed to continuing our R&D investments, demos and evaluations  with customers and ultimately realizing growth in these markets,” he adds. On 31 January, to  “enhance our long-term growth prospects”, Veeco acquired early-stage revenue  company Epiluvac AB of Lund, Sweden (whose 11 staff design and manufacture silicon carbide epitaxy systems)  for $30m in cash plus up to $35m in performance-based earn-outs. The  acquisition accelerates Veeco’s entry into the high-growth silicon carbide epitaxy  equipment market which, driven mainly by demand for power electronics in  electric vehicles (EVs), is forecasted to double from $250m in 2023 to $500m in 2027 (as the SiC device  market triples from $2bn to $6bn). “They had developed  silicon carbide previously for 4-inch and 6-inch. This is a new 8-inch  single-wafer silicon carbide reactor and mainframe, so it's an automated system that can run  independently,” says Miller. “They  have placed one system into the field, and it’s currently under installation.  The second tool shipment is actually going to ship to our Somerset New Jersey lab, where we’re  going to facilitate it and use that as a dedicated demonstration tool to sell  equipment. So we’re planning a sales kick-off meeting here in the next week or  so. With the addition of Veeco worldwide sales footprint, our service footprint  and manufacturing operations, we think we have a very good chance to be competitive  in this silicon carbide epi market,” he adds. “Given the timing of all this, not much  revenue in 2023, but hopefully some revenue growth [incremental business] in  2024.” “Compound Semi is  setting up to be a challenging year in the near-term, driven by weakness in 5G RF-related to the  smartphone weakness. In the longer-term, we do feel better about Compound Semi because these  markets we’re working in to penetrate, such as power electronics and micro-LED,  are growing and have enormous potential for us,” concludes Miller.
