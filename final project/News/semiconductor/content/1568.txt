InGaN micro-LEDs for full-color passive-matrix displays Matthew Hartensveld of Innovation Semiconductor Inc reports on a  demonstration of indium gallium nitride (InGaN) micro-light emitting diodes (μLEDs) integrated in a full-color 5x5 passive matrix [IEEE Electron Device Letters, published online 16 January  2023]. The color tunability was arranged through  deliberate incorporation of spontaneously-formed V-grooves in the μLED wafers, as previously  reported here [Mike Cooke, Semiconductor Today, 12 August 2022],  based on Hartensveld’s work last year. The V-grooves cut through the light-emitting  InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells  (MQWs) locally altering the band structure. When incorporated into μLEDs the color of the  emitted light changes according to the injected current density. Such optoelectronic behavior is of much  interest for full-color display deployment in high-resolution augmented reality (AR) and other systems. Using one  device type covering the full color range, rather than integrating a series of separate devices, usually  in incompatible III-V technologies, to cover red-green-blue (RGB) emissions,  should reduce complexity and hopefully lead to lower production costs and so  on. The μLED wafers included buffer layers strained to  optimize V-groove formation in the overlying InGaN/GaN MQW structure. The wafer growth was on sapphire, using  metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The structure was designed to  target green wavelength emission in the planar region away from the V-grooves. As usual, there were n-GaN contact and  p-GaN layers below and above the MQWs, respectively. Electrons were blocked  from overshooting the MQW by a p-type aluminium gallium nitride (p-AlGaN)  electron-blocking layer (EBL) between the MQW and p-GaN.
