POET to demo 800G optical engines and light source products at OFC In booth #5311 at the Optical Fiber  Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC 2023) in San Diego, CA,  USA (7–9 March), POET Technologies Inc of  Toronto, Ontario, Canada — a designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the data-center, telecom and  artificial intelligence (AI) markets  — is hosting live demonstrations of its optical engine and light source  products. Specifically, customers and attendees can view mechanical samples  and live demonstrations of the following products: “All of POET’s integrated optical engines are based on POET’s  Optical Interposer with hybrid integration of best-of-breed components and  monolithic integration of passive elements, resulting in an extremely small  chiplet architecture enabling the production of 800G, 1.6T and even 3.2T  transceivers in standard pluggable form factors,” says Raju Kankipati,  senior VP & USA general manager. “We will also be demonstrating  and showing mechanical samples of our innovative LightBar products, an  essential component for AI-ML accelerator GPUs, an emerging but potentially  huge market,” he adds. “As one of the optoelectronics industry’s premier  events, OFC is the perfect place to highlight our newly released products and  to continue growing our network of potential partners and customers.”
