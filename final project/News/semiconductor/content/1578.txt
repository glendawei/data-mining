Navitas fast charges global launch of OnePlus 11 5G flagship smartphone Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide  (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA says that its GaNFast technology is being  used to fast-charge the new OnePlus 11 5G flagship smartphone. The 100W SUPERVOOC charger shipped with the OnePlus 11 5G is  built around an NV6134 GaNFast IC, with integrated GaN power and drive,  plus control, protection and sensing in a high-frequency, quasi-resonant (HFQR)  topology. This enables up to three-times faster charging, and up to 40% energy  savings, in only half the size and weight compared with legacy silicon  solutions. As a result, the small 55mm x 55mm x 28mm (85cc)  charger weighs only 112g, and achieves 1.18W/cc power density. Charging  the phone’s 5000mAh battery from 1-50% takes only 10 minutes, and full  1-100% in about 25 minutes. During the official OnePlus 11 5G launch event in New Delhi  on 7 February (livestreamed around  the world), Navitas was featured as a key partner, alongside  Google, Snapdragon, Hasselblad and Dolby. Navitas has worked closely with  OnePlus, releasing a series of GaNFast chargers into mass production, and  co-operating in live events such as the promotion of the OnePlus 10T and 10R  models at Nasdaq and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2023). “Our strong collaboration with Navitas has allowed us to provide  an advanced charger that not only delivers power quickly and efficiently to the  high-capacity battery built into the OnePlus 11 5G but also keeps charger  size and weight to an absolute minimum,” says Kinder Liu, OnePlus’ chief  operating officer & head of R&D.
