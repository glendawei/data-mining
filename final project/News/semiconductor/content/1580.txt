NUBURU showcases new BL-Series blue laser at Photonics West NUBURU Inc of Centennial, CO, USA showcased its new NUBURU BL-Series at  SPIE Photonics West 2023 in San Francisco, CA, USA (28 January to 2 February), where key members of its management team  and Advisory Committee were in attendance. Founded in  2015, NUBURU is a developer and manufacturer of industrial blue lasers that  leverage their high-brightness, high-power design to produce fast, high-quality  laser materials processing, including laser welding and additive manufacturing  of copper, gold, aluminium and other industrially important metals. The firm’s  industrial blue lasers are claimed to produce defect-free welds up to eight  times faster than the traditional approaches — all with the flexibility  inherent to laser processing. The BL-Series is a new compact form-factor blue laser  enabled by a third-generation light engine design. The lasers are designed  as easy-to-service packages that can readily integrate with scanners and beam  delivery systems. The 125W BL-125 and 250W BL-250 provide high power and  brightness along with integrated power monitoring, enabling design and fabrication  efficiencies across a wide variety of industries. The BL-Series products showcased at Photonics West are  designed to bring the fundamental physical, economic and performance advantages  of the blue industrial laser to the manufacturing of products for vehicle  electrification, 3C products and additive manufacturing of copper and  other reflective materials.
