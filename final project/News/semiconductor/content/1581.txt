k-Space co-founder Roy Clarke named AAAS Fellow k-Space Associates Inc of Dexter, MI, USA –  which was founded in 1992 and produces thin-film metrology instrumentation and  software for research and manufacturing of microelectronic, optoelectronic and  photovoltaic devices – says  that its co-founder and University of Michigan physics professor Roy Clarke has  been named an AAAS Fellow  by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Clarke was named an AAAS Fellow for his contributions to the role  of interfaces in thin films and  quantum nanostructures, and for his entrepreneurship, which has resulted in  “several recent inventions and tech transfers”. He joins the ranks of other  AAAS Fellows including Thomas Edison,  W.E.B. DuBois, astronaut Ellen Ochoa, and computing pioneer Grace  Hopper.

Wiedenbeck Collegiate Professor, University Diversity and Social Transformation  Professor, and professor of physics at the University of Michigan. In 2010,  Clarke received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics  and Engineering Mentoring from President Obama. Since 1874, the AAAS has elected Fellows based on their  “extraordinary achievements”. At the AAAS Annual Meeting, Fellows are presented  with a certificate and a blue and gold rosette. AAAS is the world’s largest  general scientific society and the publisher of Science and related  journals. A profile of Roy Clarke and his work promoting diversity in applied  physics programs was published by Science  last year.
