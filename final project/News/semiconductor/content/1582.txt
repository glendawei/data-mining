Transphorm GaN FET designed into HP’s 65W USB-C PD/PPS power adapter Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near Santa Barbara,  CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride  (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion — says that its GaN technology has been used in  a Hewlett Packard USB-C PD/PPS power adapter. The firm reckons  that the design win solidifies its  GaN FET technology in the 25–350W low- and mid-power adapter space. The HP power adapter uses Transphorm’s SuperGaN Gen IV  TP65H300G4LSG 650V GaN FET. The technology is said to offer ease  of designability and high reliability with high performance. Further, Transphorm recently completed over 100 billion hours of field reliability data, with a failure-in-time  (FIT) rate of <0.05. These statistics encompass a broad spectrum of power  levels including mission-critical applications from 25W through to 3.6kW. Previously it has been verified that, compared with a larger-die  (e.g. 175mΩ) enhancement-mode GaN device, Transphorm’s smaller-die (i.e. 240mΩ)  SuperGaN FET showed lower on-resistance rise (23%) at 150°C and higher  performance at 50% and 100% (full) power, due to the inherent performance  benefits of the platform. “This is an important design win  for Transphorm as customers see the benefits of our dedication to quality and  reliability with top performance, which is now being embraced by tier-1 customers  like HP,” says Tushar Dhayagude, VP field applications  & technical sales. “Our GaN FETs  are agnostic to controllers with integrated and off-the-shelf drivers,  resulting in the ease of design and drivability which is now becoming more and  more important as we continue to gain adoption in different markets, in both  low-power and high-power segments.”
