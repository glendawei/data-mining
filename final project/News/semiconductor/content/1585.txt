Alpha and Omega Semiconductor announces silicon carbide license deal and supply agreement Power  semiconductor designer and developer Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Ltd  (AOS) of Sunnyvale, CA, USA has entered into a license agreement with a  “leading power semiconductor automotive supplier” related to AOS’s silicon carbide  (SiC) MOSFET and diode technology. AOS will license and provide engineering  support for its proprietary aSiC technology as well as an accompanying supply  agreement. The new license and supply agreement “further validates the  technical leadership of our aSiC technology,” says David Sheridan, vice president  of SiC products at AOS. “This will provide a great acceleration of our products  into the market and have the potential for our customers to secure a  geographically diverse supply chain to reduce regional risk.” AOS’s automotive aSiC MOSFETs are available from 750V to 1200V,  covering the majority of 400V and rapidly expanding 800V electric vehicle  (EV) battery systems. The SiC market is currently one of the fastest-growing segments of  the power semiconductor market; the total addressable market (TAM) is  forecasted to rise to $6bn by 2027.
