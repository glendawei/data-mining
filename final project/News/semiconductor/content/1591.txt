Qorvo introduces three-stage power solution for phased-array radar Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which provides  core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and defense  applications) has announced a  compact, three-stage power solution for phased-array commercial and  defense radar. The three-chip solution provides configurable gallium nitride  (GaN) bias point autocalibration, enabling engineers to maximize system  performance for different GaN power amplifiers (PAs) without changing the  board design. The new chipset optimizes one of the largest and most expensive  parts of a phased-array system: the pulsed-energy storage capacitors. Through a  new architecture, the solution reduces capacitance by up to 90%, shrinking  system volume by up to 30% while reducing weight and operating costs. “This complete radar power solution integrates advanced  technologies from across Qorvo, combining an innovative new power conversion  architecture, our best-in-class GaN RF power amplifiers and efficient,  reliable silicon carbide FETs,” says Philip Chesley, president of Qorvo’s  High Performance Analog business. The new three-stage solution consists of the following: Qorvo offers an evaluation board  (CB1-750-850-950) that allows customers to test the performance of this  three-stage solution with a wide set of RF GaN PAs. The evaluation board’s  intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) allows customers to reconfigure the  default settings to optimize performance for their specific PA. It demonstrates  the reduced bulk capacitor requirements and gate bias  autocalibration. The board’s flexible design can be used to evaluate the  individual stages or the entire three-chip solution with an RF PA, enabling  faster time to market.
