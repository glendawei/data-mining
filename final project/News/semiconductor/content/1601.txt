NUBURU and Tailwind finalize business combination Special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Tailwind Acquisition Corp  (TWND) and NUBURU Inc of Centennial, CO, USA have completed  their business combination (announced  on 8 August), resulting  in NUBURU becoming a publicly listed company. The combined company will operate  under the name Nuburu Inc  and its common stock and  warrants commenced trading on 1 February  on the NYSE American Stock Exchange  under the new ticker symbols ‘BURU’ and ‘BURU WS’, respectively. Founded in  2015, NUBURU is a developer and manufacturer of industrial blue lasers that leverage their  high-brightness, high-power design to produce fast, high-quality laser  materials processing, including laser welding and additive manufacturing of  copper, gold, aluminium and other industrially important metals. The firm’s  industrial blue lasers are claimed  to produce defect-free welds up to eight times faster than the traditional  approaches — all with the flexibility inherent to laser processing. “Becoming a publicly  listed company is an important milestone that we expect will provide access to  capital and continued momentum for NUBURU,” says the firm’s Dr Mark Zediker. “We appreciate  the Tailwind team’s partnership and look forward to accelerating the  development of our high-brightness products to meet the growing demand of our  customers globally,” he adds. NUBURU’s solutions in metal  processing are “critical to growing end-markets in 3D printing, aerospace, consumer electronics and e-mobility,”  says TWND’s CEO Chris Hollod. “We look forward to seeing NUBURU further  strengthen its leadership position as it continues to develop best-in-class  solutions.”
