Imec co-integrates SiN waveguide technology with active silicon photonics platform In an invited talk at SPIE  Photonics West 2023 in San Francisco, CA, USA (28 January to 2 February), nanoelectronics  research center imec of Leuven, Belgium announced that it has  demonstrated the co-integration of its silicon nitride waveguide technology with its  silicon photonics  platform — without any degradation in performance of the high-bandwidth active  devices. An important upgrade for imec’s silicon photonics platform, the result enables the  synthesis of high-quality wavelength-selective devices and other optical  passive functions that benefit from accurate optical phase control, meeting  market demands for optical transceivers for datacom, light detection &  ranging (LiDAR) and other applications. Low propagation  loss, accurate phase control, low-loss light coupling, lower thermal variation, and  high power handling  are some of the reasons why adding high-quality silicon nitride (SiN) boosts silicon photonics integrated circuits (PIC). High-quality SiN layers  achieving low optical losses and excellent control over the material  properties, such as thickness and refractive index variability, are crucial for  improving the energy efficiency of silicon-based optical transceivers. Since  such high-quality SiN layers are deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) at elevated  temperatures, it is vital to avoid degrading the performance of the  co-integrated baseline silicon and germanium devices. Imec has tackled  those integration challenges within its iSiPP silicon photonics platform, which is available for  industrial partners. Due to various engineering updates and changes in the  process flow, imec has, for example, shown a more than four times reduction in  the variability of the resonant wavelength of SiN-based micro-rings compared  with the same device made with lower-quality PECVD silicon nitride currently used in the imec  platform, without degrading the co-integrated active devices. “The ability to  co-integrate high-quality SiN devices with our baseline technology is important  to broaden our offering to our partners who can now consider system simplification  with single PIC solutions to combine active and SiN passive functions,” says Philippe  Absil, vice president  at imec.
