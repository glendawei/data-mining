Lumotive and Lumentum introduce reference design for faster adoption of 3D LiDAR Lumotive of  Redmond, near Seattle, WA, USA, which develops patented Light Control  Metasurface (LCM) beam-steering chips enabling next-generation 3D sensors,  and Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose, CA, USA (which designs and makes optical and  photonic products for optical networks and lasers for industrial and consumer  markets) have jointly announced the availability of the M30 Reference Design,  a complete software-defined sensor implementation to enable rapid adoption of  LCM-based solid-state beam-steering technology. Integrating  Lumotive’s LCM beam-steering chip with Lumentum’s M52-100 multi-junction  vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) array, the M30 Reference Design  is available now for evaluation by select customers. Lumotive is showcasing the  features of LCM beam-steering technology at SPIE Photonics West 2023 in  San Francisco, CA, USA (28 January to 2 February). “Lumentum’s  high-performance, multi-junction VCSEL arrays have unique and powerful  advantages such as increased energy efficiency and scanning accuracy, critical  for all-electronic 3D LiDAR sensor solutions,” says Rakinder Grover, Lumotive’s  VP of strategy and partnerships. “The M30 reference design seamlessly  integrates Lumentum’s M52-100 VCSEL array technology with Lumotive’s  transformative beam-steering chips. The result is a software-definable,  immediately deployable LiDAR sensor solution that addresses both the low-power  and small-footprint requirements of short- to long-range mobility and  industrial applications.” Unlike  traditional flash illumination solutions, LiDAR sensors based on LCM electronic  beam steering are said to have advantages including: “Combined with  Lumentum’s high-performance, multi-junction VCSEL technology, the LCM  beam-steering technology from Lumotive allows customers to implement true  solid-state, VCSEL-based LiDAR with software-definable characteristics in a  compact package,” says Matt Everett, senior director of product line  managment at Lumentum's Imaging and Sensing business unit. “The M30  Reference Design provides outstanding performance and the ability to  dynamically adjust the field-of-view (FoV) and region of interest.” With early  versions currently being evaluated by several leading LiDAR systems developers,  tier-1 automotive suppliers, and industrial OEMs, the M30 Reference Design  with enhanced performance and optimized for volume manufacturing is expected to  be available by mid-2023.
