EPC launches 200V, 10mΩ GaN FET Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes  enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors  (FETs) and integrated circuits for power management applications – has introduced the 200V,  10mΩ EPC2307 in a thermally enhanced QFN package in a 3mm x 5mm  footprint. The new device completes  a family of six GaN transistors rated at 100V, 150V and 200V, offering higher performance, smaller solution size, and ease of design for  DC–DC  conversion, AC/DC SMPS and chargers, solar optimizers and micro-inverters, and motor drives.
