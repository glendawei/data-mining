Diodes Inc launches its first silicon carbide Schottky barrier diodes Power semiconductor product supplier Diodes Inc  of Plano, TX, USA has released its first silicon carbide (SiC) Schottky barrier  diodes (SBD). The portfolio includes the DSCxxA065 series comprising eleven  products rated at 650V (4A, 6A, 8A and 10A) and the DSCxx120 series comprising eight  products rated at 1200V (2A, 5A and 10A).  The wide-bandgap SBDs bring the benefits of  significantly improved efficiency and high-temperature reliability, while also  responding to market demands for reduced system running costs and low  maintenance. The devices are suitable for AC–DC, DC–DC and DC–AC switching converters,  photovoltaic inverters, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS), and  industrial motor drive applications. They can also be used in a variety of  other circuits, such as boost converters for power factor correction (PFC). The efficient performance of the SiC devices is  superior to that of conventional silicon-based products, and provide power supply  designers with performance benefits such as: Three package options include surface-mount  TO252-2 (Type WX), through-hole TO220AC (Type WX) and ITO220AC (Type WX-NC). The DSCxxA065 and DSCxx120 series are available  for $1.24–2.33 and $1.70–6.68, respectively, in  1000-unit quantities.
