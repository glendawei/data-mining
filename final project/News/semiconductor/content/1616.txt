Wolfspeed and ZF to build SiC device fab in Germany, says Handelsblatt On 21 January, German  business newspaper Handelsblatt reported that, together with Germany-based ZF Friedrichshafen AG  (one of the world’s largest suppliers to the automotive industry) as a minority partner, Wolfspeed Inc of Durham, NC, USA is planning to build a  multi-billion-euro factory on the site of a disused coal-fired power  station in Ensdorf near Saarbrücken, in  the south-western German state of Saarland, to make silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductor devices for electric vehicles (EVs)  and other applications. Also at the site, a  research center is to be built, with ZF taking a majority stake, it is  reported. Previously, in November  2019,  Wolfspeed (then called Cree) and ZF extended their prior cooperation with a  strategic partnership to create electric drivelines. As the largest employer in the region, ZF operates its largest  factory nearby, where 9000 staff make transmissions. Last November, it announced its intention to convert its  transmission plant in Saarbrücken to make purely electric drives. The  firm already uses SiC devices in 800V inverters in series production. The  location of the new fab has reportedly also been chosen been because of its  proximity to automotive OEMs and tier-1s in southern Germany. Production could begin in four years, dependent on negotiations  about public-sector subsidies that normally amount to a quarter of the total  project investment, it is reported. The new plant would be larger than Wolfspeed’s newest SiC fab in  the USA – its 200mm-wafer-diameter Mohawk Valley Fab in Marcy, NY – which cost  about $2bn to establish.
