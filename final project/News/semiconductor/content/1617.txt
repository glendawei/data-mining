Enhancing interband cascades for longer wavelengths University of Oklahoma and Sandia National  Laboratories in the USA report on enhancing the performance of type-II interband cascade lasers (ICLs) in the  wavelength range 10-13μm [Jeremy A Massengale et al, Semicond. Sci. Technol., v38,  p025009, 2023]. Such devices offer efficient performance in  the 3-8μm mid-wavelength  infrared (MWIR) range, using mainly antimonide layers  on gallium antimonide (GaSb) substrates. However,  efficiency drops in the long-wavelength IR (LWIR) range of 8-15μm. This can be ameliorated  somewhat by using indium arsenide (InAs)  substrates. Further enhancements for longer wavelengths have also been  developed, and the Oklahoma/Sandia team performed a wide-ranging exploration of  their potential. The mid- and long-wavelength ranges have  many applications for gas/chemical sensing, imaging, and industrial process  control. Also, there are atmospheric windows at 3-5μm and 8-12μm, offering potential for free-space  communications.
