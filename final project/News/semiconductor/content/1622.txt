OIF hosting largest ever multi-vendor interoperability demo At the Optical Fiber Communication Conference (OFC 2023)  in San Diego, CA, USA (7-9 March), the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) is hosting  the largest ever multi-vendor  interoperability demonstration. In demonstrations in OIF’s booth #5101,  a record number of participants — more than 30 OIF-member companies — are  participating in four critical areas: 400ZR optics, Co-Packaging  architectures, Common Electrical I/O (CEI) architectures and Common Management  Interface Specification (CMIS) implementations. “Given the pace of demand for access  to broadband and the revolutionary technical advancements needed to support  that demand, interoperability is more important than ever,” says OIF Physical  & Link Layer Interoperability Working Group chair Mike Klempa of  Alphawave Semi. “This year marks 25 years of industry-changing work  bringing together an ecosystem of members to solve some of the network’s  greatest challenges, so it’s no surprise that OIF’s demo at OFC will be the  largest it’s ever hosted.” The live and static interoperable  optical networking solutions demo at OFC will feature 34 OIF member companies -  ADVA; Alphawave Semi; Amphenol; Astera Labs; Cadence Design Systems Inc;  Casela Technologies; Ciena; Cisco Systems; Coherent; ColorChip Group;  EXFO; InnoLight Technology; Juniper Networks; Keysight Technologies; Lumentum;  MACOM Technology Solutions Inc; Marvell; Microchip Technology Inc;  Molex; MultiLane Inc; NEC Corp; Nokia; O-Net Communications;  Precision Optical Transceivers Inc; Quantifi Photonics; Samtec; Senko  Advanced Components; Sicoya; Source Photonics; Sumitomo Electric  Industries; Synopsys; TE Connectivity; US Conec and Wilder  Technologies. To commemorate its 25th anniversary  during OFC, at 3pm PT on 8 March (in Theater 3) OIF is hosting a special one-hour  session ‘Bringing Order to Chaos – OIF’ feature OIF leadership, Karl Gass, OIF  and Nathan Tracy, OIF, TE Connectivity, and special guests Stephen Hardy  of Lightwave, Vladimir Kozlov of LightCounting, Sterling Perrin of Heavy Reading/Omdia,  and Alan Weckel of 650 Group.
