Oxford Instruments receives tier-1 orders for InP high-volume manufacturing equipment To support demand from high-growth markets such as communications  and sensors, indium phosphide (InP) processing capability is becoming more  advanced, with a higher degree of automation, while the industry is also  looking to migrate to 6”-diameter wafers to increase the number of die per  wafer. UK-based Oxford Instruments says that it is enabling this transition by  utilizing its high-temperature electrostatic clamping (Hot ESC) for the  PlasmaPro 100 Cobra ICP etch module, which is part of its range of  ICP InP etch processing solutions. The Hot ESC capability from 75mm wafer size  upwards is a full automation-compatible solution, which reduces manual  processing for increased reliability and repeatability (critical at larger  wafer sizes and with more complex processes). Oxford Instruments says that its development of leading-edge  processes, supported by next-generation hardware, has been recognised by the receipt  of orders from tier-1 customers. The solution is in high demand and is ready to  enable automated processing and larger wafer sizes. The orders from  leading European and Asian optical module and integrated device manufacturers  (IDMs) are supported by excellent InP market growth projections and the  expansion of manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand. Datacom and  telecom are, and will continue to be, the two biggest segments of the market,  but consumer and wearable sensors will also contribute to a compound annual  growth rate (CAGR) of 14% in InP photonics market revenue, forecasts market analyst  firm Yole. Oxford Instruments is attending the Photonics West 2023  event in San Francisco (28 January–2 February), where its experts will share the latest advances in  optoelectronics, photonics, laser and quantum technology.
