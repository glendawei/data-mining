EPC adds 80V, 11mΩ, AEC-Q101-qualified GaN FET Efficient Power  Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes enhancement-mode  gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors (FETs) and  integrated circuits for power management applications – has expanded its range of automotive,  off-the-shelf GaN transistors with the introduction of the 80V, 11mΩ EPC2252, which delivers 75A pulsed current in a 1.5mm x 1.5mm  footprint.  The EPC2252 is said to offer power system designers significantly smaller  and more efficient devices than silicon MOSFETs for automotive-grade light  detection & ranging (LiDAR) found in  autonomous driving and other ADAS applications, 48V–12V DC-DC conversion, and  low-inductance motor drives. Lower switching losses, lower conduction  losses, zero reverse recovery  losses, and lower drive power enable  high-frequency designs at high efficiency. Combined with an extremely small  footprint, these factors enable what is claimed to be state-of-the-art power density. The fast switching speed of GaN, with  sub-nanosecond transitions and the capability to generate high-current pulses  in less than 3ns, results in longer range and higher resolution in LiDAR for  autonomous driving, parking, and collision avoidance. “The EPC2252 makes an ideal switch for  automotive LiDAR, low-inductance motors, and 48V DC-DC conversions,” says co-founder  & CEO Alex Lidow. “EPC is committed to the automotive market with a growing  family of devices that enable highly efficient, low-cost vehicle  electrification and autonomous driving.” The EPC2252 is priced at  $0.91 each in 1000-unit quantities, and is available for immediate delivery  from distributor Digi-Key Corp.
