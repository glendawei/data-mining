In accordance with the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange, the  expiry date of the warrants may be accelerated to 30 calendar days if, for any  10 consecutive trading days during  the unexpired term of the warrants, the closing price of the common shares on the exchange is equal to or  greater than C$4.89 each. All other terms and conditions of the warrants remain  the same.
