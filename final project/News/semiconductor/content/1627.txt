TRUMPF Venture invests in InP PIC-based quantum technology startup Quside TRUMPF Venture of Ditzingen,  Germany is making a multi-million euro investment in startup Quside of Castelldefels  near Barcelona, Spain. Founded in 2018 after several years of R&D at the Institute of  Photonic Sciences (ICFO) in Barcelona and currently having about 30 staff,  Quside’s core product is a high-performance random number generator on an indium phosphide (InP) photonic integrated circuit (PIC)  chip that is compatible with common semiconductor manufacturing (CMOS)  processes, enabling easy mass production. Using the quantum mechanical  properties of light, the chip produces completely random number combinations very quickly (at Gb/s). This makes it  possible to improve the encryption of messages enormously, enabling  the encryption of messages that even computationally powerful quantum computers  cannot decrypt.  Picture: Quside’s indium phosphide PIC  chips. In addition to encryption, Quside’s random number  generator also enables faster and more energy-efficient calculation of  simulations, such as risk  analyses in the financial sector or weather forecasts. For example,  traffic forecasts can be calculated up to ten times faster, and energy  consumption is up to 20 times lower. Such simulations are also used by the  insurance industry, the logistics sector and the pharmaceutical industry. There is already great demand in  industries where security plays a major role. Quside’s first customers are from sectors with  high-security requirements, such as aerospace. But it is expected  that the technology could also play an increasingly important role in private  devices. The firm hence plans  to expand into the consumer market in the coming years, to use chips to  increase the security of smartphones, tablets or even vehicles. It is forecasted that the global market  for random number generators could grow to €7–10bn in  2026.
