GaN lasers from BluGlass’ Silicon Valley fab meeting or exceeding performance benchmarks BluGlass Ltd of Silverwater, Australia – which has developed proprietary  low-temperature, low-hydrogen remote-plasma chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD)  technology – says that  gallium nitride (GaN) laser diodes produced at its Silicon Valley  production facility are now achieving or exceeding contract manufacturer  performance benchmarks. Testing of  BluGlass’ first lasers processed at its Fremont fab are demonstrating  electrical and light-output performance in-line or better than previous  iterations. These results follow the successful transition of p-side processing  from contract manufacturers to its Silicon Valley fab. Reliability testing  of these lasers has begun. BluGlass  continues bringing core downstream manufacturing processes in-house, with  thinning, cleaving, n-metalization processes commencing, and facet coating  well underway. The firm is targeting vertical integration by the end of  fiscal-year 2023. “Vertical  integration is key to our commercialization strategy, enabling us to improve  our laser quality, consistency and performance while significantly speeding development  and reducing production costs,” says president Jim Haden. “This technical  milestone demonstrates the importance of operational control in accelerating  development turns,” he adds. “Our Silicon Valley production team has  commenced work on n-side processing and facet coating capabilities, which  is expected to further expedite development, production and improve laser  performance and reliability.”
