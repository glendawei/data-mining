Silanna UV introduces TO-can package for SF1 235nm- and SN3 255nm-series UV-C LEDs UV-C LED maker Silanna UV of  Brisbane, Australia has released two new products in its SF1 235nm and SN3 255nm series of UV-C LEDs: the SF1-3T9B5L1 and the SN3-5T9B5L1. Silanna UVâ€™s new UV-C LEDs feature the transistor outline  (TO-can) package format, consisting of a header and a cap forming a  hermetically sealed package to protect sensitive semiconductor components  within the package. The header supplies power to the encapsulated components,  while the cap enables the transmission of optical signals. The strong weld  between the cap and the header provides hermetic protection to the die, and the  ball lens offers a narrow viewing angle for the high irradiance  required in most sensing applications.  Using a steel header with a gold coating and an industrial-standard  TO-39 footprint, the devices have ESD protection and contain no mercury. The  TO-39 package has an 18-degree viewing angle, enhancing radiant intensity  and measurement resolution.
