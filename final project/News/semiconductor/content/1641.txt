NUBURU launches compact blue laser with third-generation light engine In booth 3086 at  Photonics West 2023 in San Francisco (28 January to 2 February),  NUBURU Inc  of Centennial, CO, USA is launching the BL-series, a new  compact-form-factor blue laser enabled by a third-generation  light engine design. Founded in 2015, NUBURU is a developer and manufacturer of  industrial blue lasers that leverage their high-brightness, high-power design  to produce fast, high-quality laser materials processing, including laser  welding and additive manufacturing of copper, gold, aluminium and other  industrially important metals. The firm’s industrial blue lasers are claimed to  produce defect-free welds up to eight times faster than the traditional  approaches — all with the flexibility inherent to laser processing. The new BL-series lasers are designed as  easy-to-service packages that can readily integrate with scanners and beam delivery  systems. The 125W BL-125 and 250W BL-250 lasers will provide high power and  brightness along with integrated power monitoring, enabling design and  fabrication efficiencies across a wide variety of industries. Advances in the new light engine  build on the range of application development that NUBURU has conducted with its  AO and AI product lines. The entire NUBURU product line is designed  to bring the fundamental physical, economic and performance advantages of the  blue industrial laser to both the electrification (energy storage,  electric vehicles) and 3C (computers, communication, consumer electronics)  sectors.
