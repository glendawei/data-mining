Vector Photonics appoints factory applications engineer Photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL)  firm Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK says that Peter  Linton has joined it as factory applications engineer, providing a technical  interface between global network equipment manufacturer (NEM) customers  and its research & development team in Glasgow. This will involve  establishing each NEM customer’s next-generation 800Gb/s interconnect  requirements as they develop devices for hyperscale and cloud data-center  applications. The firm says that the role is essential to the ongoing  commercialization of its unique, all-semiconductor PCSEL technology. “Peter will bring important direction to the ongoing development  and commercialization of Vector Photonics’ PCSELs,” says sales &  marketing director Euan Livingston. “He will drive the ‘design-in’ of PCSELs in  each NEM’s device development to inform PCSEL design, manufacture,  characterization, and systems qualification.” Linton joins Vector Photonics from spectroscopy instrumentation  product manufacturer Edinburgh Instruments, where he was product engineer,  responsible for validation testing, product integration, customer support,  continuous design improvement, training and after-sales support. Linton has a Masters degree in Physics from the University of  Strathclyde, specializing in Solid State Physics and Nanoscience.
