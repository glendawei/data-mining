EPC expands GaN ToF laser driver IC family to 80V, 15A for higher-density, lower-cost LiDAR Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes  enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power  field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for  power management applications – has introduced the EPC21701, a laser driver that monolithically integrates an 80V, 40A FET with gate driver  and 3.3V logic-level input into a  single chip for time-of-flight light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems used in robotics, surveillance systems, and  vacuum cleaners. It is tailored to LiDAR  systems for gesture recognition, time-of-flight (ToF) measurement, robotic vision, or industrial safety. The EPC21701  laser driver uses a 5V supply voltage and is controlled using 3.3V logic. It is  capable of very high frequencies greater than 50MHz and super short pulses down  to 2ns to modulate laser driving  currents up to 15A. Voltage switching time is less than  1ns and delay time from input to  output is less than 3.6ns. The EPC21701 is a single-chip driver plus GaN FET using EPC’s proprietary GaN IC technology in a chip-scale BGA  form factor that measures only 1.7mm x 1.0mm x 0.68mm.  The wafer-level packaging is small, low-inductance, and lays out very well with  the laser system. With this small form factor  and the integration of several functions, the overall solution is 36% smaller  on the printed circuit board (PCB)  compared with an equivalent multi-chip discrete implementation. The 80V EPC21701 complements the ToF  driver IC family in chip-scale  package (CSP) that also includes the 40V, 15A EPC21601  and the 40V, 10A EPC21603 options. Integrated devices in a single chip are  easier to design, easier to layout, easier to assemble, save space on the PCB,  increase efficiency, and reduce cost, notes EPC. The new family of products will enable  faster adoption and increased ubiquity of ToF solutions across a wider array of  end-user applications, it is expected. “This new family  of GaN integrated circuits dramatically improves the performance while reducing  size and cost for time-of-flight LiDAR  systems,” says CEO & co-founder Alex Lidow. “Integrating a GaN FET with driver on one chip generates an  extremely powerful and fast IC and reduces size and cost for wider adoption in  consumer and industrial applications,” he adds. “With EPC21701 we expand the  family to 80V and 15A and will soon extend the family further to 100V and  125A.” The EPC9172 development board features the EPC21701 eToF laser driver IC and is primarily intended to  drive laser diodes with short, high  current pulses. Capabilities include  minimum pulse widths of <2ns, 15A  peak currents, and bus voltage  rating of 40V. Available for  immediate delivery from distributor Digi-Key Corp, the EPC21701 eToF laser drive IC is priced at $1.95 in 1000-unit  volumes, and the EPC9172 development board is priced at $420  each.
