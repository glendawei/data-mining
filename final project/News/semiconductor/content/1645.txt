Coherent launches first commercially available 50W pump laser diodes for fiber lasers Materials,  networking and laser technology firm Coherent Corp has launched its next-generation pump laser diodes, which achieve output power  of 50W from a single chip (40% more than that of the existing product),  enabling high-power industrial fiber laser  designs with fewer pump laser diodes. The deployment of  fiber lasers for materials  processing applications such as cutting, welding, marking and additive  manufacturing is accelerating, driving the demand for key components that lower  the cost per watt of output power. “This is the  first commercially available pump laser diode  in the industry to achieve 50W of output power,” believes Dr Karlheinz Gulden, senior VP, Laser Components and Subsystems  business unit. “We continue to break  new industry records in semiconductor laser diode  output power, based on our gallium arsenide  technology platform that has decades of field-proven reliability.” The new 50W laser  diodes are available at 915nm and 976nm. The output facet width of the laser  chips is available from 150µm to 350µm, enabling optimal coupling efficiency  and output powers for a wide range of fiber laser  designs. The chips include Coherent’s proprietary E2 front mirror passivation that prevents  catastrophic damage to the laser, even at extremely high output powers. Coherent offers  pump laser diodes as bare dies, chips on ceramic submounts, and in  fiber-coupled multi-emitter modules. The firm’s broad portfolio of components  for fiber lasers includes seed lasers, acousto-optic modulators, fiber  Bragg gratings, kilowatt pump and  signal combiners, as well as IBS-coated laser optics  and micro-optics for high-power isolators. Coherent is  showcasing its solutions for life sciences, precision manufacturing, and  sensing at BiOS and Photonics West  in San Francisco (28 January to 2 February).
