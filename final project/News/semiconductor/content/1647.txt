Mini-LEDs to challenge OLEDs in high-end display market With $14bn of investment in mini-LEDs  between 2019 and 2021, mini-LED backlight units seem to be on a huge upswing.  Neglected for some time by the high-end display market – which is mainly  dominated by organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) – liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) are back  in force with a new technology building block designed to compete with the  contrast ratio and image quality provided by OLEDs. By integrating  mini-LEDs into the backlight unit, a greater number of dimming zones is  created, offering finer backlighting control, thus better managing contrast and  halo. With this prospect of enhanced performance, LCD manufacturers aim to get  a foot in the door of the high-end display market, further facilitated by  greater existing manufacturing capacity and lower investment requirements  compared with OLEDs.  However, despite the significant  technological leap that mini-LEDs bring to LCDs, display makers are struggling  to position themselves on a technology that still requires the consideration of  multiple criteria in order to make the most of a mini-LED backlight unit. Yole Intelligence, Yole SystemPlus, PISÉO and DXOMARK have hence combined their expertise to provide several reports targeting display system designers,  system architects, and marketing teams. Through analyses of a selection of four  representative displays, the companies highlight the technology options adopted  by mini-LED backlight unit designers and identify the impact on product  performance and the supply chain. For each display, two reports based on  teardown analyses are available: Yole Group and its partners studied  the following displays and provide input on key issues:
