k-Space launches XRF thin-film metrology tool k-Space  Associates Inc of Dexter, MI, USA – which was founded in 1992 and produces  thin-film metrology instrumentation and software for research and manufacturing  of microelectronic, optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices – has launched the kSA XRF x-ray fluorescence thin-film metrology tool,  which measures film thickness for materials that are too thin for reliable optical  measurements. The kSA XRF uses an x-ray source, detector  and proprietary software to measure the x-ray emission spectrum, which is then  used to calculate film thickness in real-time. It measures the appropriate  atomic species based on the customer’s unique coating formula and measurement  needs. This technique has been proven to measure semiconductor and dielectric  layers on glass panels, wafers and susceptors for applications in solar, power,  and other thin-film devices.  Picture:   The kSA XRF, which can be configured for a  standalone benchtop setup or over a conveyor for in-line inspection and  manufacturing process control (as shown here). “We developed the kSA XRF while helping one of our existing  customers measure dielectric coatings that couldn’t be measured using  traditional optical methods,” says CEO Darryl Barlett. “The XRF measures  dielectric coatings below 100nm and can be used by makers of glass panels,  solar panels, MOCVD [metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition] carriers and other products,” he adds. “It’s a superior and more  scalable option than existing tools and is easily installed into conveyor  lines.” The kSA XRF can be configured for a  standalone benchtop setup or over a conveyor for in-line inspection and  manufacturing process control. “The kSA XRF allows users to characterize  and monitor their thin-film coatings during production, thereby increasing  yield and reducing costs,” notes Barlett.
