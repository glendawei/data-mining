Cree LED releases Pro9 versions of XLamp LEDs Cree LED Inc of Durham, NC, USA (a  company of SMART Global Holdings of Milpitas, CA) has launched XLamp Pro9  LEDs, which deliver up to 15% higher efficacy for 90 and 95 color-rendering  index (CRI) LEDs without sacrificing color rendering  quality. With this performance improvement, Pro9 versions of XLamp LEDs provide  90 CRI light quality with the same efficacy as standard 80 CRI LEDs at correlated color temperatures  (CCTs) of 2700-4000K. The new LEDs are said to improve the output, efficacy and  size of LED luminaires in commercial applications requiring high-quality light. “With the availability of our new Pro9 LEDs, lighting  manufacturers are now able to achieve excellent color quality for indoor  lighting applications with increased efficiency,” says David Peoples, VP of  marketing. Unlike other high-efficacy LED solutions, Pro9 LEDs feature what  is claimed to be the industry’s highest operating temperature rating of 105°C  and the same maximum current as the standard versions. All Pro9 LEDs share the same mechanical and electrical  characteristics as the standard versions, enabling lighting manufacturers to  quickly upgrade their products to higher CRI with no change in performance and  minimal redesign effort. The LEDs are available in 2700-4000K CCTs at minimum 90 and 95  CRIs. Pro9 versions of XLamp CXB and CMA family chip-on-board (COB) LEDs are available immediately, with  product samples available now and production quantities available with standard  lead times. Pro9 versions of XLamp  CMB, CHA and CMU family COB LEDs  plus XLamp XD16 Premium White and  XHP35.2 LEDs will be available first-quarter 2023.
