Richtek and EPC collaborate to create small 140W fast-charging solution Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes  enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect  transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for power management  applications – and power management analog IC company Richtek Technology Corp of Hsinchu, Taiwan have announced the availability of a 4-switch bidirectional  buck-boost controller reference design  board that converts an input voltage of 12V–24V to a regulated 5V–20V output  voltage and delivers up to 5A continuous current and 6.5A maximum current. The combination  of the new Richtek RT6190 controller with EPC2204 GaN FETs shrinks the solution size by more than 20%  compared with traditional solutions for high-power-density applications, it is  reckoned. The solution achieves greater than 98% efficiency for 20V and 12V  output voltage and can operate without a heat-sink with maximum rise temperature below 15°C for 20V to 5V, and  55°C for 12V to 20V, at 5A continuous current. The high power  density makes this solution suitable for buck-boost converters with an input of  4V–36V and output of 3V–36V such as those used for 5V–36V battery chargers, battery stabilizers to 5V–36V  and USB PD 3.1 charging (5V, 20V, 28V, 36V support). GaN FETs provide the  fast switching, high  efficiency and small size that can meet the stringent power density  requirements of these leading-edge applications. The reference design uses the EPC2204 100V  enhancement-mode EPC GaN FET and the  RT6190 4-switch buck-boost controller with integrated GaN drivers.
