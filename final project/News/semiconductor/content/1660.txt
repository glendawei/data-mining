onsemi’s EliteSiC MOSFETs being used in Ampt’s DC string optimizers Power semiconductor IC supplier  onsemi of Phoenix, AZ, USA and Ampt LLC  of Fort  Collins, CO, USA, which provides DC optimizers for large-scale  photovoltaic (PV) solar and energy storage systems, have announced a  collaboration to meet the high demand for DC string optimizers. Ampt uses  onsemi’s N-Channel  SiC MOSFET, part of the EliteSiC family of silicon carbide  (SiC) technologies, in its DC string optimizers for critical  power switching applications.
