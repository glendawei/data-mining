CVD Equipment receives extra order for ten PVT-150 systems for SiC growth CVD Equipment Corp  of Central Islip, NY, USA (a designer and maker of chemical vapor  deposition, gas control and other equipment and process solutions for  developing and manufacturing materials and coatings) has received an additional order for ten  high-performance PVT-150 systems. For delivery in first-half 2023, the systems  will be used to grow 150mm-diameter monocrystalline silicon carbide (SiC) boules, for processing into  SiC wafers used in power electronics. Physical vapor  transport (PVT) is the leading manufacturing method used to grow SiC boules for  wafer production. As the demand for SiC devices for high-power electronics  continues to increase for electric vehicles,  energy, and industrial applications, CVD Equipment  has engineered PVT systems to support the production of high-quality SiC boules  for high-yield SiC wafers. Presently offering 150mm crystal growth systems, the firm says that it is  committed to supporting the critical high-volume production needs for the  industry and further supporting the evolution to systems of 200mm and above. “CVD Equipment Corporation is ramping up  our commercialization of the PVT systems to meet the growing needs of the  high-power electronics industry,” says president & CEO Emmanuel Lakios.  “Our 40 year legacy of developing  process equipment and our vertical integration has positioned us as a leading  manufacturer of high-quality SiC PVT systems. Our sights are set to facilitate  the industry’s growth and electrification of the future.”
