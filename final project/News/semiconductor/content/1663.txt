ROHM’s fourth-gen SiC MOSFETs to be used in Hitachi Astemo’s EV inverters Japan’s ROHM has announced the adoption of its new  fourth-generation silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs and gate driver ICs  in electric vehicle (EV) inverters made by Japanese automotive parts  manufacturer Hitachi Astemo Ltd.  Especially for EVs, the inverter, which plays a central role in  the drive system, needs to be made more efficient to extend the cruising range  and reduce the size of the onboard battery, increasing the expectations for SiC  power devices. ROHM says that its latest fourth-generation SiC MOSFETs deliver  improved short-circuit withstand time along with what is claimed to be the  industry’s lowest ON-resistance, making it possible to extend the cruising  range of electric vehicles by reducing power consumption by 6% versus silicon  IGBTs (as calculated by the international standard WLTC fuel efficiency  test) when installed in the main inverter. Hitachi Astemo, which has been developing advanced technologies  for vehicle motors and inverters for many years, already has a  track record in the increasingly popular EV market. However, this is the  first time that SiC devices will be adopted for the main inverter circuit to  further improve performance. The inverters are scheduled to be supplied to  automakers from 2025, starting in Japan and then expanding overseas. ROHM says that, going forward, as a supplier of SiC power devices,  it will continue to strengthen its lineup and provide power solutions that  contribute to technical innovation in vehicles by combining peripheral device  technologies such as control ICs designed to maximize performance.
