Odyssey shipping vertical GaN product samples to customers from Q1 Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies Inc of  Ithaca, NY, USA, which is developing high-voltage vertical power switching  components based on proprietary gallium nitride (GaN) processing  technology, says that fabrication  of 650V and  1200V vertical GaN product samples  was completed as planned in fourth-quarter 2022 and that shipments to customers  will begin in first-quarter 2023. “We will work closely with these initial customers to gain  valuable feedback on their product features,” says CEO Mark Davidson. “We  expect to secure product development  agreements with customers by the end of Q2/2023.” The completion of product sample fabrication requires significant  intellectual property to fabricate products that apply to customer use-cases,  says the firm. Odyssey adds that it continues to develop and protect the IP  required and will gain further advantage by partnering with lead customers who  will provide additional insights. Odyssey reckons that its approach to vertical GaN will offer even  greater commercial advantages over silicon than silicon carbide (SiC) or lateral GaN. Vertical GaN offers a 10x  advantage over silicon carbide at  performance and cost levels unattainable by the competing technologies, it is  claimed. Odyssey notes that the market it is pursuing is large and fast  growing. The 650V segment is the larger market currently, expected to grow at a  compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  of 20%. The 1200V product market segment is expected to grow faster, at a 63%  CAGR, and is forecasted to become the larger market in the second half of this  decade. Collectively, the 650V and 1200V power device  market is forecasted by market research firm Yole Group to grow at a combined CAGR  of 40% to more than $5bn in 2027.
