Onsemi’s silicon carbide power module selected for traction inverter in Kia’s EV6 GT model Power semiconductor IC supplier onsemi  of Phoenix, AZ, USA says that its EliteSiC family of silicon carbide  (SiC) power modules has been selected for Kia Corp’s EV6 GT  model. The electric vehicle (EV) accelerates from zero to 60mph in 3.4 seconds  and reaches top speed at 161mph. Within the traction inverter of a  high-performance EV, the EliteSiC power module enables  high-efficiency power conversion from the DC 800V of the battery to  the AC drive for the rear axle. onsemi continues to collaborate with South Korean  automakers Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Corp (HMC/KIA) to use  EliteSiC technology for the upcoming high-performance EVs based on HMC/KIA’s  Electric – Global Module Platform (E-GMP). onsemi says that its high-power-density SiC power module  delivers the package technology to minimize parasitics and thermal resistance  and offers robust package reliability using innovative interconnects. This  leads to reduced power losses associated with DC-to-AC conversion along  with reduced size and weight of the traction inverter, increasing performance  and EV range by 5%. onsemi notes that its power module technology delivers power  traction solutions through the firm’s decades of packaging expertise in  high-density power solutions for automotive applications. Packaging  technology alongside an evolutionary path from planar to trench cell structures  in SiC enable onsemi to provide highly robust and reliable solutions to  HKMC/KIA. “Our collaboration with HMC/KIA is rooted in the superior  performance of our EliteSiC technology,” says Simon Keeton, executive VP  & general manager of onsemi’s Power Solutions Group. “As  important is our quickly growing, vertically integrated SiC supply chain  that allows onsemi to plan for the necessary scale to support high-volume  production for EVs.”
