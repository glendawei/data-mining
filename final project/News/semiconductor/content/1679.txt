Nichia and Infineon launch first fully integrated micro-LED light engine for HD adaptive driving beams Three years ago Nichia Corp of Anan City,  Tokushima, Japan and Infineon Technologies AG  of Munich, Germany announced the joint development of a high-definition (HD)  light engine with more than 16,000  micro-LEDs for headlight applications. Now, both firms are launching what is  said to be the industry’s first fully integrated micro-LED light engine for HD adaptive driving beam applications. The micro-LED matrix  solution will be seen in a German premium vehicle in 2023. “The new 16,384-pixel μPLS micro-Pixelated Light Solution is our latest addition to  Nichia’s portfolio of high-class automotive lighting solutions. It combines  high-definition resolution with industry’s highest light output,” says Yusuke Yamazaki, head of sales and marketing  Automotive, Nichia Europe GmbH. “This solution enables a new  automotive lighting experience by providing four-times wider field-of-view with  significantly higher light output  than any other current micro-mirror-based HD matrix-light solution. For this  reason, the advanced HD light can warn drivers of hazards by highlighting  people or objects on or by the side of the road. It can also project markings  on the road to guide the driver through a construction site or intersection. In  addition, functions such as the glare-free high beam  or bending light work more precisely  and smoothly compared to current adaptive driving beam  solutions. This takes the driver’s road safety and driving comfort to a new  level,” he adds.  Picture: The new 16,384-pixel μPLS micro-Pixelated  Light Solution  from Nichia and Infineon.
