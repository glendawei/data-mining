Onsemi showcasing EliteSiC family of devices at CES At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2023) in Las Vegas  (5-8 January), power semiconductor IC supplier onsemi of Phoenix, AZ, USA is  showcasing three new members of its EliteSiC family of silicon carbide  (SiC) devices: the 1700V EliteSiC MOSFET and two 1700V avalanche-rated EliteSiC  Schottky diodes. The new devices provide reliable, high-efficiency performance  for energy infrastructure and industrial drive applications, the firm  says. With the 1700V EliteSiC MOSFET (NTH4L028N170M1), onsemi  delivers higher breakdown voltage (BV) SiC solutions, required for high-power  industrial applications. The two 1700V avalanche-rated EliteSiC Schottky diodes  (NDSH25170A,  NDSH10170A)  allow designers to achieve stable high-voltage operation at elevated  temperatures while offering high efficiency enabled by SiC. “By providing best-in-class efficiency with reduced power losses,  the new 1700V EliteSiC devices reinforce the high standards of superior  performance and quality for products in our EliteSiC family as well as further  expand the depth and breadth of onsemi’s EliteSiC,” says Simon Keeton,  executive VP & general manager of onsemi’s Power Solutions Group.  “Together with our end-to-end SiC manufacturing capabilities, onsemi offers the  technology and supply assurance to meet the needs of industrial energy infrastructure  and industrial drive providers.”
