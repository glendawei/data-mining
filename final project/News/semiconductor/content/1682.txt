GaN Systems unveils annual power semiconductor predictions for 2023 In its annual power semiconductor  predictions, GaN Systems Inc  of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of gallium nitride-based power switching semiconductors for power conversion and  control applications) reckons that 2023 will be another landmark year for  GaN — with the now widely adopted technology  forecasted by Yole Intelligence’s ‘Power GaN 2022: Market and Technology  Report 2022’ to reach $2bn by 2027, driven by rising adoption across  consumer electronics, automotive, data centers, and sustainability  initiatives. The predictions explore the overarching  systemic changes underway around the global semiconductor supply chain and  sustainability initiatives specific to key power-reliant industries, i.e. “We are at the inflection point for power GaN technology,” believes GaN Systems. “Notwithstanding nearly three years  of significant global economic and geopolitical headwinds, the GaN power semiconductor  has established itself as a preferred product solution across multiple market  segments, including data-center, electric vehicle, industrial, and  consumer electronics industries. It has accomplished this by uniquely  solving some of the most pressing and critical power systems challenges  around energy efficiency and design in these industries,” adds the firm.  “With the strong momentum of the electrification megatrend and an increasing  number of products containing semiconductors, economic winners and losers will  be determined mainly by those who can better manage their supply chains  that not only enable the production of existing goods for businesses and  consumers – yet stoke the fires of innovation for the near future.” The predictions are specifically as  follows:
