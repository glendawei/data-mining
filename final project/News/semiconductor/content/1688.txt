Multi-dimensional wide-bandgap power devices Three researchers based in the USA and the  UK have reviewed the potential for applying multi-dimensional (multi-D) power device architectures with a view to suggesting more appropriate  figures of merit (FOMs) compared with those applied to essentially 1D structures [Yuhao  Zhang et al, Nature Electronics, v5, p723, 2022]. Such  FOMs are key to assessing the performance limits and scaling capabilities of  power devices. The authors — Yuhao Zhang of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and  State University (Virginia Tech), Florin Udrea of the University of Cambridge,  and Han Wang of the University of Southern California — focus on multi-D structures pioneered in  silicon in an effort to beat off the competition from potentially  higher-power-capable but more expensive materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride  (GaN): superjunctions (SJs), multi-channels, fin field-effect transistor (FET),  and trigate (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Power capacity and frequency  trade-off of 1D and multi-D power devices: 1D —  thyristor, IGBT, vertically diffused MOSFET (VDMOS) and laterally diffused  MOSFET (LDMOS) — and  multi-D. N- and p-type semiconductors, oxide and metal plotted in orange, blue,  green and yellow, respectively. Circles represent electrodes. Included also  scanning electron microscope cross-sections of multi-D devices.
