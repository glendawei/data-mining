Mitsubishi Electric extends GaN HEMT range with 70W 12.75-13.25GHz low-Ku-band products Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Electric Corp is adding two new  12.75-13.25GHz (low-Ku-band) 70W (48.3dBm) gallium nitride  high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) to its lineup of GaN HEMTs  for satellite communication (SATCOM) earth stations. On sale from 15 January  2023, two products — one for multi-carrier communications and the other for  single-carrier communications — support increased data-transmission capacity  and smaller earth stations even in the low-Ku-band. Ku-band satellite communication systems are increasingly being  deployed for emergency communications during natural disasters as well as for  satellite news gathering (SNG) by TV broadcasters in rural areas where  fiber and/or cable networks are not available. For SATCOM earth stations,  existing mainstream systems use a 14GHz band, but in the near future they are  expected to use the low-Ku (13GHz) band as well as the Ka (28GHz) band to  address needs for increased data-transmission capacity. Up to now, Mitsubishi Electric has offered a lineup of seven GaN HEMTs  for multi-carrier and single-carrier SATCOM earth stations. The two new 70W GaN HEMTs  now being introduced will also support emergency communications and SNG in the  low-Ku-band.
