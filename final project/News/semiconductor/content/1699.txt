TI’s half-bridge GaN FET with integrated gate driver used in Chicony’s 65W laptop power adapter Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc (TI) —  which designs, manufactures and tests analog and embedded processing chips for  markets such as industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications  equipment and enterprise systems — says that Chicony Power has designed  in its integrated gallium nitride  (GaN) technology to power its latest 65W laptop power adapter, Le Petit.  Leveraging TI’s half-bridge GaN FET  with integrated gate driver,  LMG2610, Chicony Power and TI  collaborated on a design to reduce the size of Chicony's power adapter by 50% and increase efficiency up  to 94%. As a power supply provider committed to improving power conversion efficiency in electronic power  designs, Chicony Power has worked closely with international IC companies,  providing them with market and technical requirements to help develop solutions  in new designs. For the Le Petit  laptop adapter design, Chicony Power teamed up with TI for its expertise in  high-voltage design and its integrated GaN technology. TI’s LMG2610 is designed  to be paired with the UCC28782 active clamp  flyback (ACF) controller to create an easy-to-use, high-efficiency and  high-power-density solution for AC/DC designs under 75W. Increasingly, consumers seek smaller, lighter electronics while  also wanting to reduce their energy footprint. In the laptop power adapter market, this has challenged  engineers to find new ways to pack more power in smaller spaces while  minimizing power loss to deliver  more efficient adapters.
