Global Semiconductor Sales Increase 2.3% Month-to-Month in July by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWorldwide chip sales down 11.8% year-to-year WASHINGTON—Sept. 6, 2023—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced global semiconductor industry sales totaled $43.2 billion during the month of July 2023, an increase of 2.3% compared to the June 2023 total of $42.2 billion but 11.8% less than the July 2022 total of $49.0 billion. Monthly sales are compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization and represent a three-month moving average. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.“The global semiconductor market has experienced modest but steady month-to-month growth this year, with sales increasing for the fourth consecutive month in July,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. “Global sales remain down compared to last year, but the year-to-year decrease in July was the smallest gap of the year to date, providing reason for optimism over the remainder of 2023 and beyond.”Regionally, month-to-month sales increased in the Americas (6.3%), China (2.6%), Europe (0.5%), and Asia Pacific/All Other (0.3%), but decreased slightly in Japan (-1.0%). Year-to-year sales were up in Europe (5.9%), but down in Japan (-4.3%), the Americas (-7.1%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-16.2%), and China (-18.7%).For comprehensive monthly semiconductor sales data and detailed WSTS forecasts, consider purchasing the WSTS Subscription Package.
