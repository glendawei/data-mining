Wolfspeed extends silicon carbide wafer supply agreement with power device maker Wolfspeed Inc of Durham, NC, USA has expanded an existing multi-year, long-term silicon carbide  wafer supply agreement, now worth about $225m, with what it describe as a  leading power device company. The expanded agreement calls for Wolfspeed  to supply 150mm silicon carbide bare and epitaxial wafers. “This  agreement further strengthens our long-time cooperation with a best-in-class  power semiconductor manufacturer,” says Dr Cengiz Balkas, senior VP  & general manager of Materials for Wolfspeed. “This well-established  partnership, paired with our most recent announcement of a multi-billion-dollar  materials expansion in North Carolina, is a huge step forward in our  mission of transitioning the industry from silicon to silicon carbide.” The expansion  of Wolfspeed silicon carbide materials footprint (announced in early  September) will improve the firm’s ability to supply wafers to existing and  potential customers – a critical part of the larger wide-bandgap semiconductor  supply chain. The adoption  of SiC-based power solutions is rapidly growing across multiple markets,  including industrial and automotive. Silicon carbide solutions enable  smaller, lighter and more cost-effective designs, converting energy more  efficiently to unlock new clean energy applications. To better support  these growing markets, device makers are interested in securing access to  high-quality silicon carbide substrates to support their customers, says  Wolfspeed. The supply  agreement enables silicon carbide applications in broad markets such as  renewable energy and storage, electric vehicles, charging  infrastructure, industrial power supplies, traction and variable speed drives.
