Luminus releases Salud COB LEDs Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA, USA – which  designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology (SST) light sources for  illumination markets – has  expanded its human-centric lighting portfolio by introducing the Salud COBs.  These chip-on-board (COB) LEDs have high  R9 values, high melanopic/photopic ratios, and minimum color rendering index (CRI) of 90 in warm correlated color temperatures (CCTs) that enable users to meet WELL Building  requirements. In addition, the LEDs are said to possess exceptionally long  color stability, excellent optical emission uniformity, as well as  color-over-angle consistency, and superior thermal conductivity for uniform  heat spreading. The Salud COBs are suitable for directional lighting  applications, complementing the existing line of Salud mid-power products and  Salud CCT tunable modules. As many public spaces have opened back up with health and wellness  as a key consideration, the Salud technology that is incorporated into these  COBs enables building and lighting designers to meet the WELL Building  requirements for high melanopic lux in the vertical plane without having to  over-light the environment and without having to use cool, blueish CCTs like  6500K. Salud technology is said to help to create a healthy, productive and  comfortable environment that is suitable for offices, schools, factories, shops  and public spaces. With typical R9 values in the 90s, Salud technology has  especially high red color rendering to produce vibrant red tones, as well  as healthy skin tones, and therefore an increased ability to more  accurately diagnose medical conditions including sepsis and cyanosis. “As our industry learns more about the importance of healthy  lighting, our Salud line has been recognized as the ideal option to deliver  high melanopic lux in warm CCTs and 90 CRI quality of light,” says David  Davito, COB product line director, Illumination, at Luminus. “The new  Salud COBs are the perfect complement to our Salud mid-power line to enable  customers the ability to offer a full suite of directional, linear and panel  lighting options.”
