MICLEDI Microdisplays forms US subsidiary MICLEDI Microdisplays B.V. of Leuven,  Belgium – a fabless developer of micro-LED display modules for augmented reality  (AR) glasses that was spun off from nanoelectronics research center IMEC in  2019 – has established a US  subsidiary, located at 2820 S. Alma School Rd, in Chandler, Arizona. “Most of our target customers have locations in the Western US or  Asia, and have expressed interest in having our customer-facing support closer  to them,” says CEO Sean Lord. “MICLEDI USA was formed in anticipation of  expanding our presence in the US and Asia.” MICLEDI USA is a Delaware Corporation, formed in December 2021. While MICLEDI has operated in the US for almost two years, the new  headquarters provides a stateside location to support key personnel. “Corporate  headquarters functions, R&D, process development, and operations will  continue in Leuven, Belgium, where we work closely with IMEC as a partner in  technology and process development,” says Lord. MICLEDI says that its new US headquarters was formed in response  to customer interest in its unique expertise in micro-LEDs for AR headsets.  Customer engagement has been favourable, it adds, with many tier-1 OEMs  evaluating early samples of the company’s blue and green micro-LED arrays. “We are excited to take this next step to opening the door for  greater levels of collaboration with customers and partners in the US and  Asia,” says Seonaidh MacDonald, chairman of the board. “The team has been very  effective as a Belgian start-up since its inception in late 2019. This is a  major step forward and should position us attractively for partners, customers  and investors,” he reckons. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2023) in Las Vegas (5–8 January),  MICLEDI will be exhibiting in booth #54946  at the Venetian Expo.
