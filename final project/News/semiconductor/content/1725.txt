High temperature GaN memory and sequential logic Researchers in the USA and Bangladesh claim the highest operational temperature of 300°C for gallium nitride (GaN) delay  flip-flops (DFFs), among other circuits fabricated on a GaN/silicon platform [Mengyang  Yuan et al, IEEE Electron Device Letters, v43, p2053, 2022].  Previous DFF demonstrations have only been reported up to 160°C. The team from Massachusetts Institute of  Technology and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology also report  read-only memory (ROM), static random access  memory (SRAM), and data/D-latch components based on n-type field-effect  transistors (n-FETs) that operated at 300°C. The researchers see their achievement as  paving the way to robust mixed-signal systems operating at high temperature  (HT). They suggest applications in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas  exploration. Building on previous achievements in combinational logic, the team  has gone on to the next step: the sequential logic needed for storage of state  information. The GaN transistors (Figure 1) for the circuits were fabricated from 150mm GaN/Si wafers with  aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier and p-type GaN gate layers (p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN/Si),  provided by Dr Kai Cheng of Enkris Semiconductor Inc. The p-GaN layer enabled fabrication of the enhancement/E-mode  (normally-off at 0V gate/G potential, relative to source/S). The E-mode devices  were fabricated using a self-aligned gate-first recipe with tungsten (W)  providing a Schottky contact to the p-GaN.
