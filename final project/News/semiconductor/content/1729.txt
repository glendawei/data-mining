EPC launches 80V AEC-Q101-qualified GaN FETs for vehicle electronics and advanced autonomy Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo,  CA, USA has expanded its  range of automotive, off-the-shelf gallium nitride  transistors by introducing the 80V, 6mΩ EPC2204A (which delivers 125A pulsed current in a 2.5mm x 1.5mm  footprint) and the 80V, 3.2mΩ EPC2218A (which delivers 231A pulsed current  in a 3.5mm x 1.95mm footprint), offering designers significantly smaller  and more efficient devices than silicon MOSFETs for automotive DC–DC for  48V–12V conversion, infotainment, and light detection & ranging (LiDAR) for autonomous driving. The EPC2204A and EPC2218A are suitable for applications with  demanding requirements for high power density  including 48V–12V bidirectional converters for mild hybrid cars, 24V–48V DC–DC in cars and trucks, and for  infotainment, lighting, and advanced driver  assistance systems (ADAS)  applications.
