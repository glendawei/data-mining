Vector fast-tracks PCSEL commercialization with all-Scottish prototype supply chain Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK  says that it is  commercializing its all-semiconductor photonic-crystal  surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) using a prototype supply chain based entirely in Scotland’s  photonics cluster (a capability claimed  to be unique in the industry). Each step of the supply chain  is provided by a Scottish company that is established, profitable, independent  and competing successfully in their own respective vertical markets. Also, each  firm is a member of Technology Scotland,  the industry association representing Scotland’s wider enabling technologies sectors. “Prototype compound semiconductor  lasers can be made entirely within the Scottish photonics cluster. This  capability was identified by Vector Photonics whilst commercializing their  PCSEL technology,” notes Technology Scotland’s  CEO Dr Alastair McInroy, who visited  Vector Photonics recently to discuss the supply chain  capability further. “The prototype supply chain  provides epitaxy; front-end processing; resist, e-beam, etch and clean;  overgrowth; post-overgrowth processing; back-end-of-line; and packaging – all  from companies in Scotland’s central belt,” says Vector Photonics’ sales &  marketing director Euan Livingston. “All the companies in the supply chain  are Technology Scotland members so,  on their behalf, we are keen to raise awareness of this unique capability to  government,” says McInroy. “Strategic funding and investment could enable the  collaboration necessary to develop alpha and beta supply chains, with both individual and collective company  benefits,” he adds. “Scotland’s place as a world-leader in compound semiconductor laser development and  production would be secured, with high gross value-added (GVA) jobs created and  wider positive implications for Scottish GDP.”
