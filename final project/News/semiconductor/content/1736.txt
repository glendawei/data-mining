EPC to use VIS’ 8-inch GaN foundry from early 2023 In a multi-year agreement, Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo,  CA, USA is to use the 8-inch (200mm) wafer fabrication capabilities of specialty IC foundry service provider Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp (VIS) of Hsinchu  Science Park, Taiwan, significantly increasing manufacturing capacities for its  gallium nitride on silicon (GaN-on-Si)-based  power transistors and integrated circuits.  Manufacturing will begin in early 2023. The products manufactured at VIS (an  automotive IATF 16949 certified  foundry) will meet the growing demand for GaN power devices in data centers,  electric vehicles, solar inverters, robotics, and space systems. “VIS’ leading specialty IC manufacturing  expertise, combined with EPC’s product design  capability and outstanding figure of merit (FOM) of GaN, will deliver greater  energy efficiency for more eco-friendly high-performance computing and  electric vehicle applications,”  comments VIS’ chief operating oficer  John Wei.
