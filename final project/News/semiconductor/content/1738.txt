CML launches low-power 6–18GHz (C-, X-, Ku-band) gain blocks CML Microcircuits (part  of CML Microsystems plc), a developer of low-power analog, digital and mixed-signal  semiconductors for telecoms systems, has announced the availability of the  CMX90G701 and CMX90G702 positive gain-slope amplifiers. Developed using CML’s SµRF monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) design  capability, the general-purpose gain blocks  are suitable for wireless applications operating in the 6–18GHz frequency range  (C-, X- and Ku-bands), including  microwave backhaul, radar, satellite communications, 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) and VSAT. They can  also be used to eliminate passive equalizers by compensating for system losses  across their operating frequency range. Both devices are fabricated using gallium arsenide (GaAs)  pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (pHEMT)  process technology to achieve an optimal combination of high linearity, low noise and low DC power consumption. The CMX90G701 has +1dB  positive gain-slope, while the CMX90G702 offers a +2dB gain-slope for  applications requiring higher gain-slope compensation. Both devices deliver small signal gain of 9.5–11.5dB, a P1dB output  rating of +10.0dBm, and a low noise figure  of 3dB. As with other devices in the SµRF family,  the CMX90G701 and CMX90G702 gain blocks  are designed for ease of use, with a high level of integration, minimizing the  external component count and reduced PCB footprints. As ‘plug-in’ cascadable  gain blocks, the CMX90G701 and  CMX90G702 eliminate the need for passive equalization circuits within the  system design and, due to an on-board active-bias circuit, the devices operate  over a wide supply voltage of 2–5V, with a typical current of  22mA. Additionally, the RF ports of each device are internally matched to 50Ω,  supporting rapid product development cycles, particularly for mass-market  applications. “Following on from our earlier release of  positive gain-slope amplifiers targeting the sub-7GHz markets, the CMX90G701  and CMX90G702 low-power gain blocks  move further up the RF spectrum to 6–18GHz,”  notes Arwyn Roberts, product manager  for RF & mmWave. “These devices employ CML’s advanced SµRF design  capability and add to our growing portfolio of positive gain-slope amplifiers,”  he adds. “These devices address the growing market requirement for  high-performing mmWave devices in a range of applications including microwave  backhaul, radar, and satellite communications.” The CMX90G701 and CMX90G702 are available now,  joining the CMX90G301 and CMX90G302 low-power amplifier range. Future products  in the SµRF family will include a range of power amplifiers  (PAs), low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), gain blocks and front-end modules FEMs),  employing high-performance gallium arsenide  (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN)  technologies.
