Monolithic GaN optoelectronics on silicon Researchers in China  and Japan have demonstrated a monolithic gallium  nitride (GaN) optoelectronic  system on silicon (Si) substrate consisting of a  transmitter, modulator, waveguide, beam splitter, receivers and monitor [Hao Zhang et  al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v121, p181103, 2022]. The team from China’s Nanjing University of  Posts and Telecommunications and Zhengzhou University and Japan’s Nagoya  University are seeking to promote optoelectronic systems with low power consumption while using monolithic integration on silicon to reduce  material, processing and packaging costs. The researchers comment: “We propose  monolithic, top-down approaches to build III-nitride transmitter, modulator,  waveguide, beam splitter, receiver and monitor  as a single unit onto a conventional GaN-on-silicon wafer without involving  regrowth or postgrowth doping.” Apart from visible/ultraviolet light  communication, the team sees opportunities in lab-on-chip setups. The material for the device (Figure 1) was  grown on 2-inch Si(111) with a GaN template layer. The buffer consisted of  multiple layers of aluminium gallium nitride (850nm AlN/AlGaN) and 1030nm undoped GaN.  Figure 1: (a) Chip device layered  structure. (b) Overview.
