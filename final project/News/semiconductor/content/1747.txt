Invitalia and Midsummer agree final terms for Italian CIGS PV factory start-up The Italian  Ministry of Finance’s state investment and  economic development institution Invitalia has agreed the final contractual  term sheet for grant payments  supporting the factory investment by Midsummer AB of Järfälla,  near Stockholm, Sweden – a provider of turnkey production lines as well as  flexible, lightweight copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film solar panels for  building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Midsummer will  receive incentives of about €22m in the  form of grants to start manufacturing thin-film solar panels for the global  market. The production capacity at the factory in Bari (in the Puglia region) will be 50MW per year.  Picture: Midsummer’s factory in Bari, Italy. In the past 12 months,  Midsummer has announced 75MW of Italian offtake agreements and recently 107MW  of new offtake agreements with Swedish and international roof materials  manufacturers and other players in the industry. Simultaneously, the factory is  being prepared and equipped with machines from the parent company, recruitment  of staff etc. In the final  term sheet, the project has been slightly modified with more focus on the  manufacturing of end products and a slightly smaller budget for the R&D  part of the project. The entire project is now set to be an investment of about  €57.5m (slightly less than the original  agreement), of which Midsummer will receive about 38.2% in grants (higher than  the original agreement, which stated 35%). The grant amount of €22m (SEK240m) is in line with earlier  statements. After signing  of the term sheet, the next step in the process is for Midsummer to hand in  documentation for the costs incurred in the project so far, to facilitate the  first grant payment from Invitalia. After receipt of Midsummer’s verified  expenses, the payments are normally made within 60 days.
