Continuous-wave InGaN microdisk laser diodes on (100)-oriented silicon Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and  Nano-Bionics (SINANO) in China has achieved room-temperature continuous-wave  (CW) current-injected lasing from an indium gallium nitride  (InGaN) microdisk laser on standard (100)-oriented silicon (Si) wafers [Meixin Feng et al, ACS Photonics, published online 28 October  2022. Si(100) substrates are the mainstream basis  for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits. Unfortunately, GaN-based  structures are generally grown on Si(111) due to lattice-matching and  thermal-expansion constraints. GaN grown on Si(100) suffers from very high  threading dislocation (TD) density such that the internal quantum efficiency is much too low for microdisk  lasing. Indeed, the SINANO material was first grown on Si(111) and then  transferred and bonded to Si(100). At the same time, the team worked on  designing a structure that improved thermal management to enhance performance  and efficiency. The SINANO team see their work as  potentially leading to efficient on-chip laser sources powering photonics based  on GaN waveguides on a low-cost silicon platform. The researchers see further  opportunities for quantum optics in areas such as parametric down-conversion,  single-photon sources, ion trapping, and cavity quantum electrodynamics, along with biosensing and visible light  communication. The laser structure (Figure 1) was first grown p-side up, allowing  proper activation of the p-type magnesium-doped layers before wafer bonding.  Activation involves thermal annealing to drive out hydrogen from the growth  process, which passivates the magnesium acceptors. The laser material was then  flip-wafer bonded to the Si(100) substrate, and the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) Si(111) growth  substrate was removed.
