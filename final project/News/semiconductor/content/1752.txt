Ganvix partners with BluGlass to develop green GaN VCSELs BluGlass Ltd of Silverwater, Australia has  entered into a collaboration agreement with early-stage startup company Ganvix Inc  of Wilmington, DE, USA – which specializes in developing nanoporous gallium nitride  (GaN) vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) – to develop GaN VCSELs  for green wavelengths (515–525nm). Surface-emitting lasers require distributed Bragg  mirrors (DBRs) to enable their unique properties and, while highly successful  in other materials, have been prohibitively difficult to fabricate in GaN. Under the paid development agreement, BluGlass  will provide Ganvix with green quantum well epitaxy services using its  proprietary remote-plasma chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology,  which is said to offer key performance advantages for green wavelengths,  enabling higher-power, brighter green performance. RPCVD complements Ganvix’s  DBR technology for GaN VCSELs. Green GaN VCSELs have broad market applications  including consumer electronics, industrial, medical, life sciences,  light engines for laser scanning displays, and laser arrays for  fiber-based communications. “The advantages of BluGlass’ low-temperature  RPCVD technology provides significant commercial benefits for longer-wavelength  lasers, including green,” says BluGlass’ president Jim Haden. “Our unique  low-temperature, low-hydrogen growth technology enables brighter,  higher-performing green quantum wells – the key light emitting region in  lasers. This collaboration highlights the significant competitive advantages of  RPCVD, which transform how GaN lasers are made to improve performance,” he  adds. “Our collaboration with Ganvix will advance our RPCVD roadmaps and  expands our market opportunity. Importantly, the collaboration complements our  own product and commercialization roadmap, which is focused on edge-emitting  laser diodes.” “This significant collaboration to combine  nanoporous VCSEL architecture with BluGlass’ unique RPCVD technology provides a  path to bring green GaN VCSELs to market,” says Ganvix’s CEO John Fijol. “There  are many high-growth markets for this exciting technology, including advanced  applications such as augmented and virtual reality headsets, pico-projectors,  and 5G wireless communications.” During the initial development phases BluGlass  will receive payment for services, which it does not consider material. On  successful commercialization, BluGlass expects to receive material revenues  from ongoing orders.
