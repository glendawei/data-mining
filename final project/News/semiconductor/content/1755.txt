ROHM, Mazda and Imasen to co-develop inverters for e-Axle using SiC power modules Japan’s ROHM has  signed a joint development agreement with Mazda MotorCorp and Imasen Electric  Industrial Co Ltd for inverters and silicon carbide (SiC) power modules  to be used in the electric drive units of electric vehicles,  including e-Axle. As the ‘heart of  the EV’, e-Axle integrates a motor, reduction gearbox and inverter into a  single unit that plays a large part in determining the driving performance and  power conversion efficiency of electric vehicles. SiC MOSFETs in  particular are expected to improve efficiency even further. ROHM will carry  out joint inverter development for e-Axle by participating in a ‘cooperative  framework for the electric drive units development and production’ with  companies such as Imasen and led by Mazda. At the same time, ROHM will  contribute to creating compact, high-efficiency electrical units by developing  and supplying SiC power modules that provide improved performance. Through this  collaboration, ROHM aims to develop even more competitive SiC MOSFETs and  modules by working backwards from the finished vehicle to understand the  performance and optimal drive method required for power semiconductors. Besides creating  new value through mutual understanding between car and device makers, the three  companies also aim to support technical innovation in the automotive field and  contribute to a sustainable society by leveraging extensive knowledge,  technologies and products garnered on a global basis.
