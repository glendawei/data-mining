Power Integrations launches InnoSwitch4-Pro family of ZVS flyback ICs At electronica 2022 in Munich, Germany (15-18  November), Power Integrations Inc of San Jose, CA, USA, which provides  high-voltage integrated circuits for  energy-efficient power conversion, launched the InnoSwitch4-Pro family  of digitally controllable, off-line CV/CC Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS)  flyback ICs, which substantially reduce the size of power adapters.  Incorporating a PowiGaN gallium nitride primary switch and steady-state  switching frequency of up to 140kHz, the highly integrated devices reduce the  component count and PCB area required for ultra-compact adapters for cellphone,  notebook, tablet and multi-port accessories. “InnoSwitch4-Pro ICs interface seamlessly with Power Integrations’  ClampZero family of active clamp ICs to achieve ZVS in both continuous  conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM),” says product marketing  manager Aditya Kulkarni. “ZVS, combined with our PowiGaN technology, virtually  eliminates switching losses. Efficiency exceeds 95%, which enables designers to  eliminate the heat sinks, spreaders and potting materials typically required  for thermal management.” Further size reduction of the adapter can be achieved by using a  MinE-CAP device in combination with InnoSwitch4-Pro and ClampZero ICs. Also, based  on PowiGaN technology, MinE-CAP ICs enable a reduction in input capacitance  of about 40%.
