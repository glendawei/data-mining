3D-Micromac’s CEO presenting at mini- & micro-LED display conference 3D-Micromac AG of Chemnitz, Germany (which provides laser  micromachining and roll-to-roll laser systems for semiconductor, photovoltaic,  glass and display applications) says that, at the TechBlick ‘Mini- &  Micro-LED Displays: Markets, Manufacturing Innovations, Applications,  Promising Start-ups’ event (being held virtually) its CEO Uwe Wagner is  presenting ‘Laser technologies for the production of micro-LEDs’ on  1 December (at 4:55pm Central European Time) highlighting laser-based  system solutions for various manufacturing steps for micro-LEDs, including the  use of integrated process control and monitoring to assure stable and reliable  operation to ensure high throughput and low yield losses. 3D-Micromac says that, although micro-LEDs have tremendous potential for  future displays, several technical challenges must be overcome in the  fabrication process prior to widespread deployment in the marketplace. One key  hurdle is developing a process to release the dies from the sapphire growth wafer.  Another is developing a process to transfer these dies to the display substrate  with micron-level precision and reliability. 3D-Micromac addresses these challenges with its laser processing  solutions, including its microMIRA Laser Lift-Off (LLO) system for separating  the finished micro-LEDs from the sapphire growth wafer, and its microCETI  Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) system for moving the devices from the  donor substrate to the display substrate. To date, 3D-Micromac has sold more  than 10 laser processing systems for micro-LED applications, including a recent  order for multiple microMIRA systems from a leading optical solutions  provider. 3D-Micromac is also a founding member of the MicroLED Association, which  was established earlier this year to accelerate the adoption of micro-LED  display technologies by bringing together companies, researchers and  organizations active in the micro-LED industry and providing a forum for  solving common technology issues, fostering cooperation and sharing relevant  information, resources and tools. 3D-Micromac sees the MicroLED Association as  an important body to help establish close networking and cooperation between  customers and technology providers for further market development, and sees  group efforts around topics like standardization as key to boosting market  entry and paving the way for new display technologies.
