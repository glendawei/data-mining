Hunan Sanan secures $524m SiC chip order for NEV power systems China’s Sanan Optoelectronics Co Ltd  says that its subsidiary Hunan Sanan has signed a procurement  letter of intent (LOI) agreement to supply silicon carbide (SiC)  chips worth US$524m over the next few years for the  new electric vehicle (NEV) product line of a strategic  automotive partner. Hunan  Sanan’s SiC technology will provide energy for the NEV power system for medium- and high-voltage  platforms. “Our agreement with this strategic partner further demonstrates  the automotive industry’s commitment to providing innovative electrification  experience to the market and leveraging the advantages of wide-bandgap  semiconductors to improve overall vehicle performance,” says Hunan Sanan’s  general manager Tony Chiang. “The  agreement ensures a long-term supply of SiC to our customer to help them  realize their promise of low-carbon, smart mobility.”  Picture:   Hunan Sanan’s fab in  Changsha. The SiC chips will be manufactured in Hunan Sanan’s mega fab in  Changsha, the first vertically integrated SiC wafer manufacturing service  platform in China, which provides an in-house supply chain from SiC crystal, substrate, epitaxy, chip  manufacturing, packaging and testing, with a committed annual production  capacity of 500,000 SiC 6-inch wafers. Hunan Sanan recently obtained IATF 16949  system certification, while the automotive-grade SiC MOSFETs have been verified  with the cooperation of strategic partners, and are expected to be released in  production in 2024. Sike Semiconductor, a company jointly established by Hunan  Sanan and Li Auto, also officially  started construction in August and is expected to begin production in 2024 with  a planned annual production capacity of 2.4 million  half-bridge SiC power modules.
