ams OSRAM adds camera-optimized emitters to OSLON P1616 high-power IR LED range ams OSRAM GmbH  of Premstätten, Austria and Munich, Germany has extended its OSLON P1616 family of  small, high-power infrared LEDs, launching emitters that produce a field of  illumination optimized for the square or rectangular field of view (FoV) of IR cameras. The  OSLON P1616 products, which have a footprint of 1.6mm x 1.6mm, are said to be among the  industry’s smallest high-power IR LEDs. Also, a low profile makes them suitable  for use in the face recognition camera  system mounted in the thin bezel of a laptop computer, or in smart  doorbells. Benefiting from  advanced optical technology, the new OSLON P1616 LEDs produce a precisely  shaped beam that matches the square or rectangular FoV of IR cameras. The new  LEDs are said to provide as much as 25% more light in the FoV and more  homogeneous illumination than LEDs without dedicated optics and a pure  Lambertian light distribution. “These latest  members of the P1616 family produce remarkably high optical output power from  such a small package,” says Dominic Bergmann, product marketing manager for the  Visualization and Sensing business line.  “The excellent performance-to-size ratio of these LEDs makes them the ideal  solution for applications in which board space  or height – or both – are limited.” The new LEDs’  optimized beam shape reduces the development effort for manufacturers of  IR camera modules and systems, providing more uniform illumination of the  FoV and easing system calibration. The new OSLON  P1616 LEDs are: The optical  output (total radiant flux) from the new OSLON P1616 LEDs is 800mW for the  SFH4172, 1320mW for the SFH4182S, 700mW for the SFH41747, and 1150mW for the  SFH41847S. In addition to  laptop computers and smart doorbells, applications include CCTV cameras, access control,  eye tracking and gesture recognition as well as emerging applications such  as machine vision and medical treatment.
