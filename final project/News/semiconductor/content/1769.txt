SUSS MicroTec launches 300mm imprint platform SÜSS MicroTec SE of  Garching, near Munich, Germany (which makes photomask aligners, laser  processing systems and wafer bonders) has extended its imprint  technology to 300mm wafers and launched its new mask aligner MA12 Gen3 at the SEMICON Europa 2022 show in  Munich. The addition to the product portfolio combines photolithography,  micro- to nano-imprint, and wafer-level stacking within a compact tool. As a  semi-automated mask aligner, the MA12 Gen3 opens up a large variety of imprint  applications to research, pilot and high-volume manufacturing. Its imprint  processing capabilities for standard, advanced and high-end processes enable  technology trends such as face or fingerprint recognition, light carpets or augmented reality. Other applications include LEDs,  micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), micro-optics, and  optoelectronic sensors. High-precision parallelism between imprint stamp and  substrate is mandatory for these applications. The MA12 Gen3 meets this  requirement with the help of the leveling system developed by SUSS MicroTec.  This gap measurement technology enables significant improvements in resolution  compared with conventional methods. “It is our aim  to offer our customers a full turn-key solution for micro- and nano-imprint  that enables outstanding process performance. Our new MA12 imprint equipment is  another step towards this goal,” says Dr Robert  Wanninger, head of the Lithography business unit,  underlining the strategic importance of the new imprint lithography platform.  “Providing a tool for 300mm wafers and up to 350mm x 350mm substrates is an important part of  the imprint ecosystem we are creating.”
