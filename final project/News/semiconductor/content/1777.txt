CGD’s ICeGaN HEMTs available in high volume Fabless  semiconductor company Cambridge GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) says that its IceGaN smart  high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) monolithically integrated power solutions  are now available for volume shipment. What is said to be the industry’s first  easy-to-use and scalable 650V GaN HEMT family is also expected to be verified  as the industry’s most rugged GaN platform. Spun out of the  University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Electrical Power and Energy  Conversion group in 2016 by Dr Giorgia Longobardi and professor Florin  Udrea, CGD designs, develops and commercializes power semiconductors products  that use GaN-on-silicon substrates. “The principal values of GaN have been understood for a long  time,” notes co-founder & CEO Longobardi. “Cambridge GaN Devices’ contribution has been to innovate  the easiest-to-use, most reliable devices so that design engineers can take  advantage of the efficiency benefits offered by GaN, and deliver products and  systems that contribute to a sustainable world.”
