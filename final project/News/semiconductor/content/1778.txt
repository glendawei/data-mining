CGD and Neways co-developing GaN-based solar inverters At 10am on 17 November at Electronica 2022  in Messe München, Munich, Germany,  fabless semiconductor company Cambridge GaN Devices Ltd  (CGD) and Neways Electronics of Eindhoven, The Netherlands (which develops and  produces electronics for smart mobility, semiconductor and connectivity  solutions) are signing an agreement in Neways’  booth (Hall A1, Stand 306) to develop high-efficiency  photovoltaic solar inverter products based on gallium nitride (GaN) technology. Spun out of the  University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Electrical Power and Energy  Conversion group in 2016 by Dr Giorgia Longobardi and professor Florin  Udrea, CGD designs, develops and commercializes power semiconductors products  that use GaN-on-silicon substrates. “Neways and CGD  are perfectly aligned in our commitment to a sustainable future based on clean tech  energy,” says CGD co-founder & CEO Longobardi. “This program to jointly develop  photovoltaic products that lead the world in terms of efficiency and  performance will move the market forward,” she believes. “Neways is committed to working with like-minded innovative  companies to bring state-of-the-art, sustainable energy solutions to the  market,” says Neways Electronics’ chief technology officer Hans Ketelaars. “The combination of Neways’  extensive systems experience and CGD’s high-efficiency, rugged and  simple-to-use GaN devices is a perfect fit for this application.”
