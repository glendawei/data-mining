Infineon and Stellantis sign MoU for SiC chip supply deal Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany and global automaker Stellantis have  signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) as a first step towards  a potential multi-year supply cooperation for silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors. Infineon would reserve  manufacturing capacity and supply CoolSiC bare die  chips in the second half of the decade to the direct tier-1 suppliers of  Stellantis. The potential sourcing volume and capacity reservation have a value  of significantly more than €1bn. “We firmly  believe in electro-mobility and are excited to develop partnerships with  leading automotive companies like Stellantis that make it a part of people’s  everyday life,” says Peter Schiefer, division president Automotive at Infineon.  “Compared to traditional power technologies, silicon carbide increases the range, efficiency and performance of  electric vehicles. With our leading  CoolSiC technology and continuous investments in our manufacturing capacities,  we are well positioned to meet the growing demand for power electronics in electro-mobility,” he  adds. Infineon and  Stellantis are in talks about delivering the CoolSiC Gen2p 1200V and CoolSiC  Gen2p 750V chips for electric vehicles  under Stellantis brands. The performance, reliability and quality of CoolSiC  technology would allow Stellantis to build vehicles with longer ranges and  lower consumption – and support the company in its efforts to standardize,  simplify and modernize platforms, says Infineon. As a  high-volume supplier to the automotive industry, Infineon is preparing for the  accelerated demand of the industry with significant investments. In 2024, for  example, its new fab for SiC technologies will start manufacturing in Kulim,  Malaysia, complementing existing manufacturing capacities in Villach, Austria,  in accord with Infineon’s multi-site strategy.
