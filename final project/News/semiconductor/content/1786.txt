Navitas’ growth in data-center, EV, energy storage, solar, home appliance and industrial markets outweighs mobile softness For third-quarter 2022, gallium nitride (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide (SiC) technology firm Navitas  Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA has reported revenue of $10.2m, up  19% on $8.6m last quarter and 82% on $5.6m a year ago. However, this includes a partial quarter of revenue from GeneSiC (acquired in mid-August). Gross margin (non a non-GAAP basis) has fallen further, from 46.2% a year ago and 41.6% last quarter to 38.4% (below the expected 40%), while operating expenses have risen further, from $9.1m a year ago and $12.5m last quarter to  $14.2m (including the partial quarter of  expenses from GeneSiC). Net loss has hence risen from $6.6m a year ago  and $9.1m last quarter to $9.5m. “Despite continued softness in the mobile market, demand in the  higher-power GaN markets and for SiC remained strong, including 50 new SiC  opportunities, for which we have recently signed long-term supply agreements to  enable 5x SiC capacity expansion in 2023,” says CEO & co-founder Gene  Sheridan. “We are seeing strong demand across electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage,  solar, data-center, home appliance  and industrial markets, all fueled by the world’s pursuit to replace silicon  with more efficient GaN and SiC technologies and the commitment to address  sustainability, climate change and electrification,” he adds.
