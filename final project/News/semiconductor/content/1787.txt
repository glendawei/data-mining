Very-near-infrared InP QD laser diodes on silicon Hong Kong University of Science and  Technology (HKUST) has demonstrated electrically pumped  quantum  dot (QD) lasers grown on (001) silicon with pulsed lasing around  750nm wavelength, very near infrared, at room temperature and up  to 95°C [Wei Luo et al, Optics Express, v30, p40750,  2022]. The  dots consisted of indium phosphide (InP) in a gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP)  quantum well (QW) with aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)  barriers. The team sees potential for display, bio-photonics, and spatial mapping  applications. The researchers comment: “Embedding InP QDs  in the simple ternary GaAsP/AlGaAs QW systems provides an efficient and  reliable light source with emission wavelength at ~750nm on silicon, paving the  way toward the integration with silicon photonics for a variety of applications  near the infrared.” The team adds: “InP QD lasers on silicon with  emission wavelength at 650–750nm  are seldom explored.” HKUST also hopes that the achievements of  visible red-emitting QD lasers on GaAs substrates may soon be transferred to  (001) Si without offcut measures, often  used to improve growth quality, as needed for integration with mainstream silicon  complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics and photonics.
