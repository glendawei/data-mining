France’s DIAMFAB moves to new dual business model strategy DIAMFAB of Grenoble, France — which was spun off from France’s  National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in March 2019 to synthesize and  dope diamond semiconductor epilayers — says that it is moving to a new dual  business model strategy under which it will sell its technology directly and  through application-oriented strategic partnerships and alliances. The strategy is designed to achieve a scalable go-to-market model  implemented through a mix of in-house capabilities and an extended partner  ecosystem based on co-development. “Over  the past two years, we have made significant  progress working with R&D teams to process high-value-added diamond wafers,”  says CEO Gauthier Chicot. “Our application-oriented approach based  on a dual business model will now allow us to work with a broader set of  industrial partners, to develop and sell high-value-added diamond wafers and  our patented diamond devices manufacturing processes, while also selling  directly to end-users with a fab-light model,” he adds.
