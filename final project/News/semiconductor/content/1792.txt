Luminus releases CFT-90-WDH cool-white LED Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA, USA – which designs and makes  LEDs and solid-state technology (SST) light sources for illumination markets – has announced the launch and immediate  availability (through authorized distributors) of the CFT-90-WDH, a compact  monolithic cool-white LED source centered around the 6000K correlated color  temperature (CCT) with a high CRI (color rendering  index) of 93 (typical). The LEDs are  capable of being driven at very high currents (up to 27A DC) under both  continuous wave (CW) and pulse width modulation (PWM) conditions and  delivering 3200 lumens typical at  22.5A. In addition,  they have an extremely low-thermal resistance chip-on-board package coupled  with a robust design and median lifetime well in excess of 50,000 hours (L70/B50). Finally, the  window-less package is designed for optimal coupling efficiency into either  large-diameter fiber bundles or light engines. The CFT-90-WDH  LEDs are suitable light sources for applications that include any fiber  illumination that requires high CRI, such as medical endoscopy and other life science  applications. They can also be used widely in industrial applications including  machine vision and instrumentation, and stage lighting applications,  and are a suitable replacement for legacy lamp solutions such as xenon or  halogen lamps.
