AMP’s e-mobility Energy Management Unit using Wolfspeed’s E-Series SiC MOSFETs AMP of Los Angeles, CA, USA (which specializes in connected battery management and charging technologies for  electric mobility) has integrated the E-Series silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs of Wolfspeed Inc  of Durham, NC, USA into its e-mobility Energy Management Unit, enabling it to optimize battery  performance, charging and costs. Wolfspeed’s E-Series MOSFETs  are optimized for use in automotive applications, such as traction inverters,  electric vehicle (EV) on-board  battery charging, and high-voltage  DC–DC converters. “At AMP, we  understand the power that silicon carbide  brings to vehicle electrification. We are proud to collaborate with another  US-based company on technologies that make a greener and smarter tomorrow,”  says Jiaqi Liang, VP of hardware engineering at AMP. “The use of Wolfspeed’s  silicon carbide in AMP’s Energy  Management Unit (EMU) unlocks higher power density  and efficiency, better platform scalability, and precise charging control. All  are acutely observed by consumers through improvements in cabin space, charging  time, and lower cost.” AMP’s market-ready  energy management solution integrates  ultra-fast DC charging, DC–DC, and bi-directional on-board AC charging into a single platform,  providing optimal charging experience, monitoring, care and performance of  batteries. “AMP’s  integration of our technology signals continued growth for silicon carbide in the automotive industry,” says  Jay Cameron, senior VP & general manager, Power, at Wolfspeed. “The  expansion of our automotive-qualified 650V and 1200V E-Series silicon carbide MOSFET portfolio allows AMP to  easily deploy their products for either 400V or 800V systems,” he adds.
