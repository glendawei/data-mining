Fairview adds 10–200W high-power amplifiers Fairview Microwave Inc of Lewisville, TX,  USA (an Infinite Electronics brand that provides on-demand RF, microwave and millimeter-wave  components) has broadened its line of high-power amplifiers designed for multiple market applications in VHF,  UHF, L, S, C, X and Ku bands. The line of broadband high-power amplifiers  includes mainly  gallium nitride (GaN) and some LDMOS designs. GaN performance benefits are  the most desirable for broadband applications and exhibit high efficiency in a  smaller package size. The high-power amplifiers provide saturated  output power levels ranging from 10W to 200W. Amplifier designs are available  in compact coaxial packages covering broadband frequencies ranging from 1.5MHz  to 18GHz. Fairview’s high-power amplifiers are available in rugged,  military-grade coaxial packages with operational temperatures from –40°C to +85°C.  The highly efficient Class AB designs feature 50Ω input and output matched ports, built-in control and protection  circuits, and D-sub connectors for DC bias, command control, and  monitoring functions. “Designers will find these broadband high-power amplifiers  extremely useful for test and measurement applications, as well as transmitting  RF signals for radar, military radio, and telecommunications systems,” says senior product manager Tim Galla. The new high-power amplifiers are in-stock and  ready for immediate shipment with no minimum order quantity.
