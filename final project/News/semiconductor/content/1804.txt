Seoul Semi wins high-power LED patent lawsuit in Germany South Korean LED maker Seoul  Semiconductor Co Ltd  has announced another victory in a patent infringement lawsuit against a global  electronic components distributor of high-power LEDs in Germany. This continues  Seoul’s record of successes in patent litigation. In October, the Düsseldorf Court issued a preliminary injunction  for infringement of Seoul’s patent against various LEDs manufactured by Luminus  Devices Inc and Lite-On Inc, and distributed by Mouser  Electronics Inc. Lite-On, which manufactured LEDs subject to the injunction, was  also sued for patent infringement in the USA in April 2021 by Seoul’s affiliate  Sensor Electronic Technology Inc  (SETi). Nitride Semiconductors Co Ltd and Nitek Inc have also filed patent infringement lawsuits against  Lite-On in US courts. Seoul and its affiliates say they have prioritized patent enforcement  against companies that have refused to take responsibility for selling  infringing products, including Seoul’s prior litigation against Enplas Corp and Everlight Electronics Co Ltd. In the past four years, Seoul has secured eight injunctions in Europe  against the sale of infringing products, including cell phones, electronic home appliances, and general lighting products.
