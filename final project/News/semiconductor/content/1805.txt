CompoundTek collaborates with Siemens and Ansys to launch PDK 3.0 Singapore-based silicon  photonic (SiPh) foundry services provider CompoundTek Pte Ltd has partnered with Siemens Digital Industries Software and Ansys-Lumerical  to develop and release CompoundTek’s process design kit (PDK) version 3.0. With the vision of enabling  best-in-class photonic circuit  simulation for customers, PDK 3.0’s  Component Model Library (CML) offers new elements and enhanced performance. Formerly Mentor Graphics, Siemens’  Electronic Design Automation (EDA)  solutions provide a broad array of design and verification solutions for  photonic designers, including L-Edit Photonics  and LightSuite Photonic Compiler, both of which work with CompoundTek’s PDK 3.0. These tools provide productivity  improvements for photonics experts and IC designers  through automation and custom layout. Siemens’ Calibre verification platform,  which includes Calibre nmDRC with its proprietary equation-based functionally,  has extended its golden signoff status to include silicon photonic designs. A total of 18 new components/enhanced  performance in both O and C wavelength bands; SiN Y-splitter, SOI Y-splitter,  SiN MMI 1x1, SiN MMI 2x2 and new black box cells etc are added in this latest  PDK release.
