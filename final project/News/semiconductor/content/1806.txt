The  firm is now owned by a new group of long-term institutional investors,  including Anchorage Capital Group LLC, Nut Tree Capital  Management LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP. Also, Steve Barlow, president of Lumileds’ Automotive  business unit, is to be appointed CEO and to its board of directors,  succeeding Matt Roney (effective on 11 November). Barlow brings over 30 years of experience in the  semiconductor and LED lighting industries and several decades at Lumileds,  having most recently served as president of Lumileds’ Automotive  business unit and prior to that as president of the Lighting Solutions  business unit. He first joined the firm in 2003 to help build its LED  automotive, camera flash, display and lighting businesses as head of sales  & marketing. He previously held management and sales roles at Hewlett Packard,  Cree and Intematix Corp. Barlow holds an MBA from Santa Clara  University and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from San Jose State  University. “We are pleased to have completed this process effectively and  within the timeframe we originally projected thanks to the support and  dedication of our employees, customers, vendors, suppliers, and our new  owners,” says Roney. “It has been a privilege to lead this extraordinary  company and team,” he adds. “Lumileds holds a strong position as industry leader and innovator,  with incredibly talented and committed people,” comments Barlow. “We enter this  next stage poised for further growth, positioned to capture opportunities, and  in an improved position to address changing global market environments.”
