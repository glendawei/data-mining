HG begins production of GaN power electronics epiwafers Hong Kong-based HG Semiconductor Ltd  recently began manufacturing its own 6-inch gallium nitride (GaN) power electronics  epitaxial wafers, which have hence now officially entered full-scale production.  This was far earlier than the expected timetable, as the firm’s technical team  has capitalized on its experience to debug production facilities and technology  in just three months, paving the way to the rapid industrialization and mass  production of GaN ‘third-generation’ semiconductors. The GaN epiwafer market reached US$420m in  2021, and is projected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2%  from 2022 to US$1.5bn in 2028. HG Semiconductor reckons that epiwafer  manufacturing represents a “giant leap” in reaching its ultimate goal of the mass  production of chips. The firm now expects to begin pilot production of chips in  second-quarter 2023, followed by mass production by early 2024. Also, in  second-half 2022, the firm has launched GaN-related fast-charging products.
