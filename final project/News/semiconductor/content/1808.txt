Navitas and VREMT open joint R&D lab for EV power systems and semiconductors Gallium nitride  (GaN) power IC and silicon carbide  (SiC) technology firm Navitas Semiconductor of Torrance, CA, USA says that on  1 November Charles (Yingjie) Zha, VP  & general manager of Navitas China, and Shuibao Guo, vice  general manager of VREMT of Ningbo, Zhejiang, China (a subsidiary  of Geely Group that supplies electric powertrains to ZEEKR, Volvo, Polestar and  Lotus), opened a joint R&D power semiconductor laboratory in Ningbo. Working with power system design  tools and in close partnership with the system design teams of VREMT (Viridi  E-Mobility Technology (Ningbo) Co Ltd), the lab will host Navitas engineers,  with the aim of accelerating electric vehicle (EV) power system  developments using Navitas’ GaNFast power ICs and GeneSiC  power MOSFETs and diodes. As wide-bandgap power semiconductors,  GaN and SiC deliver higher efficiency at faster switching speeds, with smaller  system size and lower costs than silicon chips. EV power conversion  systems can hence deliver faster-charging, faster-acceleration, longer-range  and lower-cost EVs, accelerating the transition from fossil-fuel to clean-air  vehicles. The joint R&D lab will be further  supported by Navitas’ own EV System Design Center in Shanghai, which helps  customers to maximize GaN and SiC performance advantages, including  high-frequency magnetics design plus advanced packaging and modules to create  higher-power-density, higher-efficiency and lower-system-cost power electronics  systems for EVs. “Navitas’ next-generation power  semiconductors bring enormous value to VREMT’s design teams,” comments Guo. “We  expect that Navitas’ high-frequency power system expertise will greatly  reduce time-to-prototype and time-to-market for VREMT systems,” he adds. “This new partnership is aligned on both  technical goals and also for sustainability, as both companies focus on carbon  neutrality,” comments Zha.
