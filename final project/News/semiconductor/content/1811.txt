Qorvo and SK Siltron CSS sign long-term silicon carbide supply agreement Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which  provides core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and  defense applications) has finalized  a multi-year agreement for the supply of silicon carbide  (SiC) bare and epitaxial wafers from compound semiconductor  wafer maker SK Siltron CSS of Auburn,  MI, USA (a subsidiary of South Korea-based  SK Siltron, a part of the SK Group). The agreement should promote domestic semiconductor supply chain resilience and a greater ability to  support the rapidly rising demand for silicon carbide  solutions, specifically in the automotive market. It is also aimed at providing  end-user customers a level of protection and confidence as they adopt Qorvo's  Gen 4 SiC FETs. SiC devices are more efficient at handling high powers and  conducting heat than traditional silicon. When used in electric vehicle (EV) system components, this  allows more efficient transfer of electricity from the battery to the motor,  increasing the driving range of an EV by 5-10%, it is reckoned.
