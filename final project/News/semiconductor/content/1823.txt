Riber’s revenue halves in Q3, impacted by difficulties sourcing electronic components For third-quarter 2022,  Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam  epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources and effusion cells – has  reported revenue of €3m, more than halving from €6.8m in Q2/2022 and €6.6m  a year ago. For the first nine months of 2022 (to end-September), revenue was €12.2m  (56% of which came from Asia, 37% from Europe, and 7% from North America). This  is down 23% year-on-year from €15.8m for  the first nine months of 2021. Specifically, MBE  Systems revenue halved, from €7.5m to €3.7m, due to the postponement of the  delivery of two systems to fourth-quarter 2022 in the context of difficulties  sourcing electronic components. However, Services  & Accessories revenue grew by 2% from €8.3m to €8.5m, confirming the  positive trend for research and production MBE activities. Following the  positive trend for order intake in first-half 2022, Riber says that it has  consolidated its position on the market during Q3/2022, confirming four system  orders (including two production systems) while continuing to focus its  development on services & accessories. The order book at  end-September was hence €39.1m, up 93% on €20.3m a year previously. Specifically, the order book for  Services & Accessories remains €7.7m (the same as a year ago). However, the Systems order  book has grown by 149% from just €12.6m to €31.4m, comprising six production  and eight research systems in 2022 (compared with two production systems and five  research systems in 2021). Also, this does not include (1) the order announced  on 25 October for one research system and (2) the option to buy (announced  on 8 June) covering four production systems (for which firm orders will be  confirmed in 2023 when the export license is obtained). Riber says that  the current large order book already ensures strong growth in 2023 revenue to over  €40m (compared with €31.2m).  The firm adds that, in a dynamic market environment with strong  demand for its systems, it expects to continue taking orders during  fourth-quarter 2022.
