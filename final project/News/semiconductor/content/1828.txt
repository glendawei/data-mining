Sumitomo Electric develops N-polar GaN HEMT using Hf-based gate dielectric On 17 October at the 2022 IEEE BiCMOS  and Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuits and Technology  Symposium (BCICTS) in Phoenix, AZ, USA, Japan’s Sumitomo Electric  Industries Ltd (SEI) reported that it had developed a gallium nitride  high-electron-mobility transistor (GaN HEMT) that uses N-polar GaN and,  for the gate insulating layer, what is reckoned to be the world’s first hafnium  (Hf)-based, highly heat-resistant, high-dielectric material, targeting the  post-5G era, which will realize even greater capacity and high-speed  communications. In the future post-5G era, the transistors  used in communication devices will be required to support higher power and  higher frequencies for increased volume of data transmission. Conventionally, Ga-polar (0001  orientation) GaN has been widely used. Along with the demand for further higher  power and higher frequencies, however, attention is being focused on the  improvement of characteristics with N-polarity (000-1 orientation), which  enables an inverted HEMT structure that increases the degree of freedom in  device design and can reduce leakage current. Meanwhile, N-polar crystals have  the problem of being prone to irregularities caused by abnormal growth called  hillocks. In addition, in terms of device design, the realization of an  inverted HEMT structure required the development of a high-quality gate  insulating layer that would serve as a barrier against the gate electrode in  place of the conventional semiconductor barrier layer. Sumitomo Electric says that it has hence  used its years of experience in crystal growth technology to realize  high-quality N-polar crystal without hillocks. In addition, by applying a type  of hafnium-based highly heat-resistant and high-dielectric material (used in  state-of-the-art silicon transistors) to the challenging gate insulating layer  for the first time, the firm has created an N-polar crystal transistor  incorporating a high-dielectric material and achieved what are said to be  excellent high-frequency characteristics. The newly developed N-polar GaN HEMT (using Hf-based gate dielectric) is a result of  the ‘Research and Development Project for Strengthening Post-5G  Telecommunication System Infrastructure’, commissioned by Japan’s  New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
