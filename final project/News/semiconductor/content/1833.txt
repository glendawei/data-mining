KYOCERA AVX Salzburg and VisIC expand collaboration for GaN-based e-mobility VisIC  Technologies Ltd of Ness Ziona, Israel – a fabless supplier of  power conversion devices based on gallium nitride (GaN) transistors  for high-voltage automotive applications – and Austria-headquartered automotive  electronic component maker KYOCERA AVX Salzburg (Kyocera-AVX Salzburg, which has production  sites in North America,  China and Europe) are expanding their collaboration. The partners are combining their strengths in packaging, assembly and  GaN wafer technologies with the aim of providing high-current components for  high-voltage applications such as charging and e-drivetrains. The expansion aims to fulfill the automotive industry’s demands for  reliable and highly efficient power solutions that will save on electric vehicle (EV)  costs. With the best thermal resistance it is reckoned, discrete GaN devices and  half-bridge modules will be essential for future on-board chargers (OBC) and  traction inverters, optimizing weight, size, costs and driving range.
