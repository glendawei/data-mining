GaN Systems releases Class D GaN FET amplifier boards and audio boost converter solutions GaN Systems Inc of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of  gallium nitride-based power switching semiconductors for power conversion and control  applications) has released  two complete Class D high-performance GaN FET amplifier boards and two complete audio boost converter  solutions for marine, auto and battery-powered vehicles. The firm now provides  a comprehensive solution set consisting of turnkey amplifier designs, power supplies and boost converters — allowing audio systems designers across auto, home and professional  markets to mix and match designs to maximize performance for their specific  applications. Leveraging GaN Systems  GS61008P GaN power transistors, the new designs are optimized for sound  quality, efficiency (no heatsinks), size and cost — while enabling audio design  engineers to create premium audio products more quickly at affordable prices  while reducing time to market. GaN Systems’ power transistors are critical  components of next-generation audio products and address essential needs in the  Class D audio market — expected to reach $3.6bn by 2024, according to  analysts. Contributing to the growth is rising demand for consumer electronics  and smart home devices, more excellent traction in in-vehicle infotainment  systems in automobiles and a rise in demand for energy-efficient technologies  in portable and compact devices.
