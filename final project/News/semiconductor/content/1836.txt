Nitride Semiconductors releases micro-RGB + UV LED chips trial kit Nitride  Semiconductors Co Ltd of Tokushima, Japan says that, in addition to micro-ultraviolet (UV) LEDs  with a peak wavelength of 385nm, it has developed three types of  indium gallium nitride (InGaN)-based visible micro-LEDs with peak  wavelengths of 620nm for red, 510nm for green, and 450nm for blue, grown by metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on a 4-inch or 6-inch sapphire  substrate.  Picture: Red, green, blue, UV, micro LED chip  emission spectrum data — 48μm x 48μm chip. In 2018 the firm  achieved high-efficiency light emission at a peak wavelength of 385nm from  12μm x 24μm micro-UV-LEDs (subsequently patented), and it has already  supplied samples to many users. The firm has since also developed visible LEDs,  in response to many customers requesting micro-sized chips for red, blue and  green LEDs. In this case, especially for red LEDs (which are considered to be difficult  to realize), InGaN has been used instead of the conventional materials  gallium arsenide (GaAs) or gallium phosphide (GaP). Nitride Semiconductors is developing displays by exciting three  types of red, blue and green phosphors with micro-UV-LEDs. Furthermore, it has  developed mass-production technology for red, green, blue microchips. So, users  can achieve mass production of micro-LED displays through conventional method  of mounting three types of micro-LED chips (red, blue and green). To allow users to  compare the characteristics of each color, Nitride Semiconductors has  created a micro-RGB + UV LED chips trial kit (a complete set of micro-LEDs with  four wavelengths: red, blue, green, and UV). Developers of micro-LED displays  can hence try chips with various wavelengths and sizes and select the optimum  chip for the mass production of micro-LED displays.
