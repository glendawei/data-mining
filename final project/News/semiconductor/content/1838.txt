Aledia and QustomDot to co-develop full-color micro-LED displays Aledia S.A of Echirolles, near Grenoble,  France (a developer and manufacturer of 3D micro-LEDs for display applications  based on its large-area gallium nitride  nanowires-on-silicon platform)  and Belgium-based Ghent University spin-off  QustomDot (which combines quantum dot synthesis, surface engineering and  ink/photoresist formulation into patterned color conversion layers for  micro-LED displays) have joined forces to leverage their expertise and  co-develop a full-color micro-LED technology that will address the video wall and luxury TV markets. Aledia has unique 300mm GaN-on-Si nanowire technology that is said  to unlock scalable manufacturing of micro-LEDs, enabling highly efficient blue  micro-LEDs to be produced for a first range of high-end micro-LED products. “We have worked for several years on combining our unique GaN  nanowire micro-LED platform with quantum dots,  taking advantage of the exceptional color quality of quantum dots; however, in the past the quantum  dots have often been a limiting element in the final micro-LED performance,”  says Aledia’s CEO Giorgio Anania. “Together with QustomDot’s innovative quantum dot (QD) inks, we believe a  higher-performing range of micro-LED products could be within reach,” he adds. Belgium-based QustomDot leverages its quantum dot platform to enable what is claimed to  be the most all-round and reliable heavy-metal-free color conversion solution on the market. “While  many technologies are being developed in the field, we believe that Aledia’s  ambition and vision can drive the micro-LED market to the next phase,” comments  QustomDot’s CEO Kim De Nolf. “We have found that both our technology platforms  are a great fit for this emerging market,” he adds. The joint collaboration  will initially target the video wall  and luxury TV markets, and first  prototypes are expected to roll out in early 2023.
