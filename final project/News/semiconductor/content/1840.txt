Navitas’ EVP & GeneSiC founder inducted into NCSU ECE Alumni Hall of Fame Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC firm Navitas  Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland, says that  Dr Ranbir Singh, executive VP of its GeneSiC business unit, has  been inducted into the North Carolina State University’s Department of  Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Alumni Hall of Fame. The NCSU ECE Alumni Hall of Fame celebrates the accomplishments of  outstanding graduates who have used their education to excel in a profession,  career or service. Singh’s induction was based on his pioneering career in  high-performance, high-reliability silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors  for high-power, high-voltage applications. This includes several innovation and  R&D awards, plus the founding in 2004 of GeneSiC Semiconductor (acquired by  Navitas in August). Singh holds a Bachelor of Technology, Electrical Engineering from  the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and both a master’s and PhD in  Electrical Engineering – Power Semiconductors, from NCSU. He also holds over 40  US patents and has presented and published over 200 journal and conference papers. “We welcome Ranbir to the NCSU ECE Alumni Hall of Fame,” says Jay  Baliga, Progress Energy Distinguished University Professor of the ECE  Department at NCSU, who served as Singh’s doctoral thesis advisor. “Since he  graduated, we have followed his career and ground-breaking work with SiC  technologies closely and are happy to have played a role in his success. A very  small number of experts are chosen for the Hall of Fame, from more than 15,000  ECE alumni, making this a truly noteworthy distinction,” he adds. “I look back fondly on my time at the university and within the  ECE Department, which formed a solid foundation for my work in power electronics  and the development of the advanced technologies on which the success of  GeneSiC was built,” commented Singh during the induction ceremony on 21 October.
