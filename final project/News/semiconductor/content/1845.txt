Lowe’s LED filament bulbs ruled to infringe EPISTAR patents On 4 October, in ‘EPISTAR Corp versus Lowe’s Home Centers LLC’, the United States District Court of the Central District of California issued its  post-trial decision that confirmed the jury verdict that Lowe’s Home Centers’ LED filament bulbs infringed three patents of EPISTAR of Hsinchu,  Taiwan (a subsidiary of Ennostar Inc) and rejected Lowe’s arguments that challenged the validity of the  EPISTAR patents. The three EPISTAR patents were (1) US Patent No. 7,560,738 (‘Light-Emitting Diode  Array Having An Adhesive Layer’), (2) US Patent No. 8,492,780 (‘Light-Emitting Device  And Manufacturing Method Thereof’), and (3) US Patent No. 6,346,771 (‘High Power LED Lamp’). In its decision, the court specifically upheld the jury finding that  Lowe’s LED filament bulbs manufactured by Zhejiang Yankon Group Co Ltd infringed claims 1-3 and 8 of the ‘738 Patent, claims 1, 3 and 7 of the ’780 Patent and claim 38 of the ’771 Patent. The court post-trial decision further confirmed that each of the claims  infringed by Lowe’s were valid over the prior art. EPISTAR says that it has invested millions of dollars in the R&D of  LED technologies that has led to a patent portfolio consisting of more than  4000 issued patents and pending patent applications. This investment has laid  the foundation of LED lighting  technologies that have empowered products including the LED filament bulb at issue  in this case. “Innovation is extremely important to the industry and should be  respected and awarded fairly to drive the evolution of technology,” says the  firm. EPISTAR adds that it will continue its enforcement activities against  those using its technology without authorization.
