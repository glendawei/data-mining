RF detection with InGaAs and GaN HEMTs Researchers based in Spain and France  report on the relative merits of indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and gallium  nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility  transistors (HEMTs) as radio frequency (RF) signal detectors [G. Paz-Mart&iacute;nez et al, J. Appl. Phys., v132,  p134501, 2022]. The researchers — six from Universidad de Salamanca, Spain, and  one from Université de  Lille/Université de  Valenciennes, France —  believe that the InGaAs HEMT RF detection frequency range could reach at least  the sub-terahertz range and perhaps even above 1THz. The devices were operated in the region of “third-quadrant conduction” (TQC) where a sharp  non-linear increase in drain current occurs due to the channel opening for  negative values of drain bias.
