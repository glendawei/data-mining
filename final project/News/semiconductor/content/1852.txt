Infineon’s CoolSiC power devices chosen by Bloom for Energy Server and Electrolyzer Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany says that its  CoolSiC MOSFETs and CoolSiC diodes have been chosen by California-based Bloom  Energy to process electrical power in its hydrogen-powered Energy Server  and Electrolyzer. Bloom Energy’s fuel cells and electrolyzers address climate change  and offer multiple pathways to zero-carbon emission. They enable a  combustion-free method for generating resilient, sustainable and predictable  energy. The individual solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) of the energy  platform run on natural gas, biogas or hydrogen. With high electrical  efficiency, the system provides a continuous power supply that is robust  to grid failures and weather conditions from -20°C to 45°C.
