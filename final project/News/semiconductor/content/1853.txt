Furukawa selects Aixtron’s AIX 2800G4 MOCVD system for opto device production Deposition equipment maker Aixtron SE of  Herzogenrath, near Aachen, Germany has received an order from Japan-based compound semiconductor device maker Furukawa Fitel Optical Device Co Ltd  (FFOD) for an AIX 2800G4 metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)  system, to be used for the development and the production of optoelectronic  devices based on gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP)  materials. Aixtron claims that the AIX 2800G4 platform  is the market-leading tool for the production of various semiconductor devices  due to the performance of the Planetary Reactor concept with respect to  thickness and wavelength uniformity control of epitaxial layers. The firm also  claims that the proven system for high-volume manufacturing provides highest  efficiency in the use of chemicals while delivering superior yields for most  advanced optical devices due to wafer-level process control. “We are very pleased to see Furukawa  becoming one of our G4 users,” says Aixtron’s  CEO & president Dr Felix Grawert. “With our team of hardware and  process experts in Japan, we are looking forward to this new cooperation,  supporting Furukawa to swiftly ramp up the platform for their existing and  future products.”
