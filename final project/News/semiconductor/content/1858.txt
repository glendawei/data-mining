Silanna UV launches far UV-C 235nm and deep UV-C 255nm LEDs Silanna UV of Brisbane,  Australia has launched far UV-C and deep UV-C LEDs that take advantage of the firm’s patented short-period  superlattice (SPSL) technology for what it claims is industry-leading  performance in the difficult-to-obtain 230–265nm UV range – including the  highest output power in any  mass-produced UV LED at 235nm. Silanna UV says that its patented SPSL approach overcomes many of  the difficulties that plague competing aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN)  UV-C LED technologies. By engineering a nanostructure from alternating  layers of AlN and GaN, Silanna UV has developed a new material that is  said to be easier to control and have far superior properties to traditional  AlGaN. Silanna says that its SPSL mitigates several issues that AlGaN has for  short-wavelength LEDs, particularly the older method’s poor light extraction  and electrical performance. The new far UV-C 235nm SF1 series and deep UV-C 255nm SN3 series  are both available in either 120º or 30º viewing-angle SMD packages, making  them suitable for a wide range of applications. The 30º package’s parabolic  lens provides greater irradiance than even traditional UV lamps, the firm  says. Both the SF1 and SN3 series have low power consumption and long  operating lifetimes.  The new LEDs are suitable for various deep UV and far UV  sterilization, water and gas sensing, and instrumentation applications. The SF1  and SN3 series are powerful, small-footprint deep UV-C emitters that  deliver long lifetimes and high conversion efficiency.
