Lumileds again boosts LUXEON 5050 Round LED performance On the sixth anniversary of its first 5050 LED, Lumileds LLC of San Jose, CA, USA has  again increased the light output and  efficacy of its LUXEON 5050 Round  LED. Introduced in October 2016,  output and efficacy have increased by 14% to 693 lumens  and 178 lumens per Watt at 4000K CCT (correlated color temperature) and 70CRI (color rendering index). Further, the portfolio  (available through Lumileds’ global distribution network) has grown in breadth  and is claimed to be the only 5050 offering with a full array of CCT options at  70, 80, and 90 CRI. “Sometimes the most obvious element is ignored even though it’s  the most important factor for a system,” says product manager Mei Yi. “A round light-emitting surface is  critically important if you want to achieve a symmetrical light distribution  with pleasing uniformity and smooth transitions without jeopardizing optical  efficiency, lens design complexity, and cost.” In fact, optical solution provider LEDiL lists more than 200 lens  and reflector choices to address a wide variety of applications and design  parameters.
