GaN Systems’ power transistor used in Renesas’ automotive 48V/12V bidirectional DC/DC converter GaN Systems Inc of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of  gallium nitride-based power switching semiconductors for power conversion and  control applications) says its GS61008P 100V enhancement-mode  GaN-on-silicon power transistor is powering the new automotive 48V/12V  bidirectional DC/DC converter of Renesas Electronics Corp of Tokyo, Japan,  resulting in significant power density improvements and a 46% reduction in  system size. The Renesas  solution targets 48V mild hybrid vehicles and electric motorcycles, which  require high-efficiency 48V/12V DC/DC converters. GaN allows for high switching frequency  at high efficiency — meaning smaller magnetics and a much smaller size. GaN Systems  says that its GaN HEMTs allows a 50% smaller PCB area compared with using  silicon MOSFETs. Benefits of  the new converter are said to include: “Customers in  automotive are constantly looking for improvements in power density and  cost, and this design is another reflection that GaN delivers significant  improvements in power density in a smaller, more efficient and cost-effective  design,” says CEO Jim Witham. “The fact that the design comes from Renesas is  significant, as they are a market leader in semiconductor solutions for  automotive, with a reputation for understanding the needs of the industry,” he  adds. “This is a major step to bring the benefits of GaN technology to this  customer base.” While GaN has  significant traction in industries like consumer electronics, it is  becoming the technology of choice for power conversion and battery  charging in hybrid and electric vehicles, the firm claims. GaN offers much  higher performance than silicon and silicon carbide at very low cost — making  it possible to cost-effectively reduce the weight and increase the efficiency  of a wide range of electric vehicles, it adds.
