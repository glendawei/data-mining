Riber’s order book up 76% year-on-year to €30.6m at end-June For first-half  2022, Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam epitaxy  (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources and effusion cells – has reported  revenue of €9.2m, slightly below the €9.3m a year previously. “Customer demand  remained very strong, as evidenced by the large number of orders recorded since  the start of the financial year, with 13 systems ordered in nine months and an  option for four additional systems,” says Riber. “However, the constraints in  the electronic component supply chain  led to system assembly delays and prevented further deliveries over the  period.” Nevertheless, MBE  system revenue was €2.9m, up 5% from about €2.8m in first-half 2021. Revenues  for Services & Accessories was €6.3m, down 3% from €6.5m. Gross margin was  30.9%, up from 27.5% in first-half 2021, due to the change in product mix. Operating  expenditure rose by €0.5m due to sustained R&D investments (up 14% to €1.8m)  and the increase in sales & marketing costs in the context of rising order  intake (up 15%), while administrative costs are stable overall. Loss from ordinary  operations has risen from €1.9m (21% of revenue) to €2.1m (23% of revenue).  However, net loss has been cut from €1.8m (19.3% of revenue) to €1.6m (17% of  revenue). This includes €0.6m of financial income and expenses, linked  primarily to the evolution of the €/US parity. The cash position  at end-June 2022 was positive at €7.7m, up €1.8m from the end of 2021. During first-half  2022, new order intake improved significantly, comprising four production  systems and five research systems, while maintaining growth in Services &  Accessories. This recovery  further strengthened the order book at the end of June to €30.6m, up 76% from €17.4m in a year previously. Specifically,  the Services & Accessories order book rose by 10% from €6.9m to €7.6m,  confirming the positive trend in MBE research and production activities. The Systems  order book more than doubled (up by 119%) from €10.5m to €23m. This included 11  machines: four production systems (versus just one  in 2021) and seven research systems (versus four in 2021). Also, this does  not include (1) orders announced in July and August for two Compact 21  research systems, one MBE6000 production system and one MBE49 production  system, as well as (2) the option to buy announced on 8 June covering four  MBE6000 production machines (for which firm orders will be confirmed when the  export license is obtained in 2023). Riber says that, in  a still buoyant market environment, with strong demand for its systems, it  expects to continue taking orders through 2022. Faced with supply chain  constraints, to reduce the shortage of electronic boxes (which are crucial  components for its MBE machines to operate), Riber has diversified its sourcing  capacity with its supplier partners. However, supply chain delays will  likely cause system deliveries to be postponed to 2023. Also, the  significant increase in energy costs will have a very limited impact on the  company's activity due to the low energy consumption in the company's  production processes. Riber says that, over  the longer term, it is moving forward with a project for profitable growth  based on its technological and industrial know-how, as well as its capacity for  innovation. Driven by new information technologies, it is rolling out a  strategy focused on further strengthening its position in MBE, achieving  regular growth in its service activities, and maintaining a robust level of  R&D investment to expand its portfolio of technologies and applications.
