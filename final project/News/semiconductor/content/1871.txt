Lumentum expands specialty optical fiber manufacturing operations and R&D in Slovenia Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose, CA, USA (which designs and makes  optical and photonic products for optical networks and lasers for industrial  and consumer markets) has  expanded its manufacturing operations and advanced R&D in Škoflijica,  Slovenia for specialty optical fibers  that are essential components of many Lumentum products. This expansion more  than doubles Lumentum’s manufacturing and R&D footprint in Slovenia. “Specialty  optical fibers are a key enabling component for industrial fiber lasers and increasingly for other new  applications in the industrial, life sciences,  and communications markets,” says Alex Schoenfelder, senior VP & general manager of Commercial Lasers. “Our team in Slovenia has  given us unique fibers that enable differentiated performance and cost.”
