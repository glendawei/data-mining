IQE collaborating with SK siltron on GaN epi for Asian markets Epiwafer and substrate maker IQE plc of  Cardiff, Wales, UK has entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with silicon wafer supplier SK siltron of Gumi, South Korea (an affiliate company of  Seoul-based SK Group, South Korea’s third-largest conglomerate) for the development  and commercialization of compound semiconductor products. The agreement formalizes a strategic agreement to develop business in  the Asia market, leveraging SK siltron’s substrate expertise with IQE’s epitaxy  capabilities. IQE and SK siltron will focus on developing and delivering epiwafers  based upon gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon carbide (SiC) for radio frequency applications in the wireless  communications market (e.g. high-performance 5G networks, including massive MiMo base stations) and GaN on  silicon (Si) for power electronics applications across a range of markets (e.g. automotive,  consumer and industrial). Combined, these markets represent a  multi-billion-dollar opportunity for GaN devices and are forecast for strong  growth in consumer, telecom and automotive applications.  “There are tremendous  synergies between IQE’s GaN pedigree and SK siltron’s substrate offerings, and  we will leverage these to bring innovative solutions to market,” says IQE’s CEO Americo Lemos. “Expansion in Asia is a key focus for IQE and we  are excited to be partnering with a globally recognised leader in advanced  materials,” he adds. “Two world leaders in  advanced materials are joining forces to jointly develop products for exciting  growth markets related to GaN materials,” says SK siltron’s  CEO Yongho Jang. “I am  looking forward to building considerable success with IQE and developing the  relationship to cover a broad range of semiconductor materials.”
