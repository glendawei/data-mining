Asahi Kasei demos Crystal IS UVC LED-based water disinfection Tokyo-based Asahi Kasei and its subsidiary Crystal IS Inc of Green Island, NY,  USA, which makes proprietary ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UVC LEDs),  have concluded in a bacterial performance test that an experimental Klaran WR water treatment reactor demonstrated  over 75% higher performance than a traditional low pressure mercury lamp system using an equivalent power consumption level. Klaran WR is an inline point-of-use (PoU) water treatment reactor  (see Figure 1, left) that combines  Crystal IS’ UVC LEDs based on aluminium nitride (AlN) substrates (Figure 1, right) with Asahi Kasei’s R&D capability in the design  and application of optics and fluid dynamics.  Picture:   Klaran WR is an inline point-of-use (PoU)  water treatment reactor (Figure 1, left) which combines Crystal IS’ UVC LEDs  based on aluminium nitride (AlN) substrates (Figure 1, right),  with Asahi Kasei’s R&D capability in the design and application of optics  and fluid-dynamics. Figure 2 shows the disinfection performance of  the mercury lamp system (left) and the experimental  Klaran WR  (right). While conventional UV water treatment systems have used mercury  lamps as a light source, nations  around the world have adopted stricter regulations after the Minamata  Convention on Mercury became effective in 2017, due to the hazards that mercury  poses to health and the environment. UVC LEDs have been developed as a  mercury-free light source featuring  small size, light weight and flexibility in design. A key milestone speeding  the transition to this light source is demonstrating that the disinfection performance,  power efficiency and value of LED technology can fully meet or exceed the  incumbent mercury lamp. While it is widely understood and accepted that UVC LED’s instant  on-off capability offers a significant advantage and better alignment with  actual consumer use than an ‘always on’  mercury lamp system, a question  remained whether an equivalent-powered LED system could demonstrate equivalent  disinfection performance as a low-pressure mercury lamp  system. The experimental Klaran WR  reactor was developed to demonstrate that UVC LEDs can achieve this.
