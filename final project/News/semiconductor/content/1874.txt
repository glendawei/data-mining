EV powertrain semi market to grow at 31% CAAGR to $27bn in 2029 Driven by consumer awareness and  government regulations and mandates related to climate change and the need  to reduce emissions and reverse the impacts of global warming,  electric vehicle production is growing at a compound annual average  growth rate (CAAGR) of 26% from 2021 to 2026, and volumes will approach  54.1 million units by 2029, forecasts the Strategy Analytics  Electric Vehicles Service (EVS) report ‘xEV Semiconductor Demand Outlook 2021-2029’.  This in turn will drive demand for corresponding xEV powertrain semiconductors,  which is forecast to grow at a CAAGR of 31% to $27.3bn by 2029. Semiconductor demand covered in the analysis include key systems  necessary for the operation of mild hybrid, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and  battery electric  powertrains. This includes battery management  systems, DC/DC converters, main traction inverter,  electric motor, and onboard  charger. Battery electric vehicles  will comprise the largest demand sector, growing at a CAAGR of 39% and  accounting for 82% of the total electric vehicle  powertrain semiconductor market opportunity in 2029, it is forecasted.  “Semiconductors required for power electronics will comprise the  largest market, with growth accelerating in line with the push towards battery  electric vehicles and the  move towards higher-performing, more efficient wide-bandgap semiconductors,”  notes Asif Anwar, executive director  at Strategy Analytics.  “This will translate to the market for SiC (silicon carbide) growing at a CAAGR of 39% over 2021 to 2026 and  grow through 2029 to reach $8.3bn, at which point we will have reached a  tipping point with SiC semiconductor demand exceeding that of silicon power semiconductors.”
