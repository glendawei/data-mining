Aehr enhances FOX-P wafer-level test & burn-in systems for SiC and GaN Semiconductor test and reliability qualification equipment supplier Aehr Test Systems  of Fremont, CA, USA has released two new enhancements for its FOX-P  family of wafer-level test and burn-in systems – the FOX Bipolar  Voltage Channel Module (BVCM) and Very High Voltage  Channel Module (VHVCM) options – which enable advanced capabilities for  silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) power semiconductors. SiC power devices and  modules are being widely adopted in the drive train  used in electric vehicles (EVs) as  well as on-board and off-board electric vehicle  chargers. GaN-based semiconductors are at the early stages of their application  usage, but are expected to grow significantly in their use in a wide range of  power conversion applications  including photovoltaic, industrial and other electrification infrastructure  applications. The new capabilities allow silicon carbide  and gallium nitride semiconductor  manufacturers more flexibility to address a wider variety of stress and burn-in  conditions to address their engineering qualification and production needs in  FOX-P multi-wafer test and burn-in systems. These options are available with  new system shipments or for upgrades of previously shipped FOX-P systems, with  first shipments planned with typical 12-16 week lead times.
