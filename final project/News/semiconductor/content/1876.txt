CrayoNano launches CrayoLED H-series of UV-C LEDs CrayoLED by CrayoNano provides a new disinfection solution for  air, water, and high-contact surfaces 
CrayoNano AS of Trondheim, Norway – which  develops and manufactures semiconductor components based on patented and  proprietary nanomaterials technology – has launched the CrayoLED H-Series (CLH-N3S) of ultraviolet-C  light-emitting diode (UV-C LED) packaged components. The firm says that  CrayoLED’s quality-driven design meets the high standards for reliability and  performance in the fast-growing industrial and commercial disinfection and  sanitization market. “CrayoLED is a robust and powerful UV-C LED component tailored to  the needs of our partners,” says chief revenue officer  Michael Peil. “Our team has developed — in close collaboration with our key  customers — a high-performance, reliable technology that enables downstream  improvements in disinfection that will ultimately result in a cleaner and safer  environment.” The CrayoLED is optimized for disinfection at a typical peak  wavelength of 275nm. Its small package footprint (3.5mm x 3.5mm) and  high power performance (typically 80mW optical power at 350mA) easily integrates  into systems for residential, commercial and industrial segments, enabling  system miniaturization and longer-lasting solutions, CrayoNano says. The CrayoLED H-series (CLH-N3S) is available in both sample  quantities and in stock for volume production.
