HexaTech investment accelerates 100mm AlN substrate program HexaTech Inc of Morrisville, NC, USA (a  subsidiary of Stanley Electric Co Ltd of Tokyo, Japan) says that its 100mm-diameter single-crystal  aluminium nitride (AlN) substrate  product development program, which has been in the early stages of development  over the last year, is being accelerated through a significant investment in  human resource and capital  expenditures, addressing all areas of the manufacturing process (from crystal  growth through polishing). Claiming to be the world’s leading commercial  supplier of single-crystal physical vapor  transport (PVT)-grown AlN substrates, HexaTech aims to continue to drive product  performance and production scale. “The 100mm-diameter AlN product in development is targeted at  supporting the rapidly expanding deep UV  optoelectronic commercial market, as well as the needs of the nascent AlN-based  power and RF device development efforts,” notes Gregory Mills, VP of business development. “This capability will  deliver not only a dramatic improvement in price per unit area, allowing for lower device costs, but will integrate well with  established customer fabrication lines already operating at 100mm,” he adds. “HexaTech’s history of developing and delivering AlN material with  industry-leading structural and surface quality serves as a reliable foundation  for scaling our AlN PVT growth process to larger diameters, while maintaining  our established quality standards,” says co-founder & chief technology officer Dr Raoul  Schlesser. “Based on our proven technology, we fully expect to sustain these  capabilities as we move towards a 100mm product,” he adds. “With this strategic program focused on substrate diameter  expansion, coupled with the substantial financial investment to support it,  HexaTech once again demonstrates its commitment to advance the state-of-the-art  in AlN substrate technology,” says CEO John Goehrke. All of HexaTech’s 2-inch-diameter products, including its full  range of deep UV transparent  substrate products, are available now with standard lead times.
