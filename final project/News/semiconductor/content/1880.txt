IQE partners with MICLEDI to develop micro-LEDs for AR products Epiwafer and substrate  maker IQE plc of Cardiff, Wales, UK has  entered into a partnership with MICLEDI Microdisplays B.V. of Leuven, Belgium, focused on the large-scale  commercialization of micro-LED technology. Spun off from  nanoelectronics research center IMEC in 2019, MICLEDI is a  fabless semiconductor design and technology company developing unique,  high-performance micro-LED displays with a primary focus on augmented reality (AR) products. Under  the agreement, IQE will provide MICLEDI with a 200mm (8-inch) platform to scale  and commercialize the technology to achieve high-volume production for red  micro-LEDs. This geometry allows for compatibility with both standard 200mm and  300mm silicon foundries, enabling the partnership to deliver economies of  scale. “Micro-LEDs are the future of immersive display  technologies and this agreement expands IQE’s position in a market which is  poised for multi-billion dollar growth across a range of end-market  applications, including everyday consumer electronics,” says IQE’s CEO Americo Lemos. “Compound semiconductors are a critical enabler of scale in  this market and we are pleased to be partnering with MICLEDI to offer a  differentiated solution,” he adds. “By combining MICLEDI’s unique micro-LED arrays  with IQE’s innovative 8-inch platform, we have formed a natural partnership to  commercialize and scale our solution to address the high-growth micro-LED  market,” says MICLEDI’s CEO Sean Lord. “Our augmented reality products will  enable new user experiences, and we look forward to delivering this innovative  technology under our new partnership.”
