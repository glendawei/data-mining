SemiQ launches 1200V 40mΩ SiC MOSFET SemiQ of Lake Forest, CA, USA – which  designs, develops and manufactures SiC components and 150mm SiC epiwafers for  high-frequency, high-temperature and high-efficiency power semiconductor  devices – has expanded its  portfolio of SiC power devices by launching  its second-generation silicon carbide  power switch, a 1200V 40mΩ SiC  MOSFET. This complements the firm’s existing 80mΩ SiC MOSFETs and SiC  rectifiers at 650V, 1200V and 1700V.  SemiQ says that it has engineered the MOSFET to provide the best  trade-off of conduction and switching losses to benefit the widest possible  range of applications. SiC MOSFETs bring high efficiency to high-performance applications  including electric vehicles (EVs),  power supplies and data centers and are specifically designed and  tested to operate reliably in extreme environments. SemiQ says that, compared  with legacy silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), its MOSFETs  switch faster with lower losses, enabling system-level benefits through reduced  size, weight and cooling requirements. SemiQ’s new 1200V 40mΩ SiC MOSFET is available in TO-247-4L and  TO-247-3L packages and will soon be available in multiple module packages. Samples  are in stock at SemiQ and available through distributors DigiKey, Mouser and  Richardson Electronics.
