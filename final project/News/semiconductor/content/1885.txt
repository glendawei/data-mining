SweGaN raises €12m in Series A financing to expand production capacity SweGaN AB of Linköping, Sweden, which  manufactures custom gallium nitride on silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC) epitaxial wafers (based on a unique growth  technology) for telecom, satellite, defense and power electronics applications, has completed a Series A financing round totaling SEK125m (€12m).  The financing was co-led by Intertech Ventures, Mount Wilson Ventures and European investor  Atlantic Bridge, with  participation by STOAF of Sweden and global fabless semiconductor firm  MediaTek, forming a global network spanning the USA, Taiwan and Europe. Fred  Chang of InterTech Ventures, David Lam of Atlantic Bridge and semiconductor  manufacturing executive Walter Wohlmuth have joined SweGaN’s board. SweGaN reckons that the performance of its GaN epitaxy process  opens up new applications in the multi-billion-dollar GaN-based radio frequency  (RF) and power markets. Powered by its patented QuanFINE buffer-free GaN-on-SiC  epiwafers, customers can reach levels of device performance and reliability  previously unachievable with conventional materials available on the market, it  is claimed. The firm has more than 30 paying customers and is in qualification  for a wide range of applications in Europe, the USA and Asia. The investment allows SweGaN to significantly increase production  capacity to meet market demand from major suppliers of 5G base-stations,  defense radars, low-orbit satellite communications and on-board chargers in  electric vehicles (EVs). Additionally, the financing empowers the firm’s  plans to expand its executive team and to boost engineering, sales and  production staff. Picture: SweGaN’s CEO Jr-Tai Chen. In conjunction with the investment, from 1 September, chief technology officer Jr-Tai ‘Ted’ Chen (who co-founded  SweGaN in 2014 and invented its proprietary QuanFINE technology) has been appointed CEO,  replacing chairman Jonas  Nilsson (who has been interim CEO since the fall 2020). “I look forward to our continued work together to fulfill  SweGaN’s strategy, vision and future-oriented goals for serving the industry  with the best GaN-on-SiC technology available on the market,” says Nilsson. “Since starting SweGaN, Ted has displayed  remarkable determination, passion and professional growth, and he is well  equipped to lead SweGaN’s in this next chapter of its journey to become a  dominant player in the GaN-on-SiC market,” he adds. “As we move from silicon to the third  wave of semiconductor materials, GaN and SiC are poised to dominate,” believes David  Lam, general partner at  Atlantic Bridge. “SweGaN’s revolutionary GaN-on-SiC technology brings together  these two key materials to enable RF and power performance characteristics that  are simply impossible to achieve today,” he adds. “This strategic financing round  enables us to lift SweGaN to the next level and beyond in our growth journey  and positions us to execute on the SweGaN vision and strategy,” says Jr-Tai  Chen. “To meet explosive market demand, SweGaN’s roadmap  targets building of new production facilities and expanding our team to deliver  of tens of thousands of epiwafers annually,” he adds. “We are thrilled to welcome seasoned semiconductor investor Atlantic Bridge and global fabless semiconductor leader MediaTek as investors into SweGaN,” comments Richard Weil, general partner at Mount Wilson Ventures. “We have been delighted to support SweGaN through the early stages of development and commercialization of its industry-leading epitaxial technology. Now, with this financing, SweGaN has access to the financial resources and industry experience required to scale to the next level.”
