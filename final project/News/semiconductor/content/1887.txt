Navitas showcases pure-play WBG solutions for EVs at ECCE 2022 Navitas Semiconductor of  El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland is  showcasing gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC)  wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor technologies at the IEEE Energy Conversion  Congress & Expo (ECCE 2022) in Detroit, Michigan  (9-13 October), which features both industry-driven and  application-oriented technical sessions, as well as industry expositions and  seminars in electrical and electromechanical energy conversion. With US auto sales forecasted to be mostly  electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, Navitas’ 650V-rated GaNFast power ICs  with GaNSense technology are optimized for the broad range of 400V-rated EV  battery applications and AC-interfacing. New Navitas GeneSiC 1200V FETs and  diodes address 800V-rail applications for higher-power trucks, buses and  performance passenger cars. The firm also says that its EV System  Design Center provides complete platform designs to accelerate  time-to-market, including a 3-in-1 800V-rated bi-directional charger and DC-DC  converter, with up to 18% weight savings, up to 20% energy savings, and up  to 65% faster charging than competing solutions, it is reckoned. “Upgrading from legacy silicon to GaN and  SiC accelerates EV adoption by two years,” says Llew Vaughan-Edmunds,  senior director of marketing. “ECCE is a critical forum for professionals  working to optimize power conversion across the EV landscape, and a fertile  environment for detailed discussions on new technology adoption,” he adds. On Monday 10 October at ECCE 2022,  Navitas is featuring in a focus session on SiC and GaN applications in EVs  (from 12.30pm to 2.10pm, EST).
