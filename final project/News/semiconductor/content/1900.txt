pSemi’s 5G mmWave switch reaches volume production Murata  company pSemi Corp of San Diego, CA, USA – a fabless provider of  radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) based on silicon-on-insulator  (SOI) – has announced the  production readiness of a new single-pole four-throw  (SP4T) switch targeted at wideband and high-frequency applications up to 67GHz. Claimed to be an  industry-first, the compact and energy-efficient switch is designed to enhance  5G millimetre-wave (mmWave) systems and short-range connectivity. Offering  best-in-class insertion loss,  linearity, switching time and power  handling for frequencies up to 67GHz, the PE42545 is part of a family of mmWave  switches that can help designers simplify layouts and improve overall system efficiency in test & measurement,  wireless infrastructure, non-terrestrial networks and point-to-point  communication applications. “As commercial mmWave  deployment accelerates, our customers need high-performance switches that are  broadband, very low insertion loss  and stellar return loss for a  high-performing mmWave signal chain,”  says Vikas Choudhary, VP of sales & marketing.  “With more than 30 years of  expertise in high-frequency semiconductor invention and manufacturing, pSemi  provides high-performance, dependable mmWave solutions that our customers and  partners can count on.” Available in flip-chip die  form, the PE42545 UltraCMOS SP4T switch is said to deliver the RF performance,  reliability and size to meet challenging mmWave system designs from 9kHz to  67GHz. Specific properties are listed as: With the test & measurement industry facing the unique  challenge of needing to stay ahead of the 5G mmWave technology learning curve  to deliver advanced testing solutions, equipment must support higher power handling, high linearity, low insertion loss and fast switching to efficiently  pressure test scenarios up to 67GHz  under extreme conditions. For test & measurement designers seeking to simplify complex  broadband designs, a single PE42545 SP4T can replace multiple SPDTs used in  cascaded filter bank configurations  to reduce space and offer band-select paths with less insertion loss. Having access to scalable and  reliable components ensures that designers can easily adapt system designs to  different band configurations as 3GPP standards evolve in 5G, 5G-Advanced and  6G, says pSemi.
