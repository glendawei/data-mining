Ampleon showcases new 700W L-band GaN-SiC HEMT at EuMW In booth #B36 at European Microwave Week (EuMW 2022)  in Milan, Italy (27-29 September), Ampleon  Netherlands B.V. of Nijmegen, The Netherlands is showcasing its latest solutions  and products in gallium nitride (GaN) and LDMOS technologies, including  those targeting wireless infrastructure, avionics/defence, non-cellular  communication, cooking/defrosting, and industrial, scientific & medical (ISM)-related  applications.  A key highlight is the new CLL3H0914L-700 gallium nitride on  silicon carbide (GaN-SiC) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT). This  rugged GaN transistor is optimized for radar implementations where long pulse width  and high duty cycles are required. The transistor was engineered to  achieve over 700W of peak output power from a single transistor while operating  at a voltage of 50V with industry-leading efficiency of over 70% as well as  designed thermally for long-pulse applications, such as pulse widths (~2ms) and  20% duty cycles. The L-band GaN HEMT’s superior performance capabilities are  demonstrated in a variety of application reference designs shown at the  booth, including ones for defence/aerospace bands (960-1250MHz and  1030-1090MHz) plus an L-band ground base radar (1200-1400MHz). The CLL3H0914LS-700 high-power-density and low-thermal-resistance  HEMT is now in full volume production. Units are available directly from  Ampleon or authorized distribution partners RFMW and Digi-Key. Large-signal  models in ADS and MWO can be sourced via Ampleon’s website.
