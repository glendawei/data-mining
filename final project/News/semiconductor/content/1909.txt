Boron nitride pulsed laser deposition Researchers in the USA report on pulsed laser deposition of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on  gallium nitride (GaN) with a view to optoelectronics  and high-power electronics [Abhijit  Biswas et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v121, p092105, 2022].  The bandgap of h-BN is ~5.9eV,  considered an ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) relative to WBG GaN at ~3.4eV. The team from Rice University, Oak Ridge  National Laboratory and DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory found the h-BN/GaN to  be second-harmonic generation active, and Schottky diodes formed from the  material had a higher reverse-bias breakdown voltage, compared with Schottky  diodes fabricated on GaN.
