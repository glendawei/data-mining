Navitas and JP showcase GaN and SiC at electronica India Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo,  CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland is participating alongside official  distributor JP Electronic Devices in booth EB-21 (Hall 10) at  electronica India 2022 at the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida (21-23 September). Navitas is showcasing its portfolio of wide-bandgap (WBG)  semiconductors, which includes the latest family of gallium nitride (GaN)  GaNSense half-bridge power ICs, which are said to enable a new level of  MHz switching frequencies while dramatically reducing system cost and  complexity compared with existing discrete solutions. Also on show is technology from silicon carbide (SiC) firm GeneSiC  (acquired in August), whose MOSFETs and diodes are optimized to meet the power,  voltage and ruggedness demands of applications such as uninterruptible power supplies  (UPS), solar inverters, wind turbines, industrial motors, smart grids,  and electric vehicles (EVs). “India and the southern Asian region are key markets for Navitas  and electronica India provides an ideal platform to showcase our  technologies to designers and engineers developing new generations of applications  focused on efficiency and sustainability,” says David Carroll, senior VP  of worldwide sales.
