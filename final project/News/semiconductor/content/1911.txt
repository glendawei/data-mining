Starting in 2019, onsemi added SiC polished wafer and SiC epitaxy  wafer production to its existing silicon polished and epitaxy wafer and die  manufacturing in Rožnov. Having outgrown  the original site, construction of a new building began in 2021 to further  expand wafer and SiC epi manufacturing. Over the next two years, this expansion will increase the  site’s SiC production capabilities by 16 times and create 200 jobs by the end  of 2024. So far onsemi has invested more than $150m in the Rožnov site and plans to spend an additional  $300m through 2023. onsemi was recently awarded the Association for Foreign  Investments (AFI) Prize for Significant Contribution in the Field of Investment  for its SiC investments in the Czech Republic. “Together with our SiC boule production expansion in Hudson, NH,  these increased SiC manufacturing capabilities enable onsemi to provide  customers the critical supply assurance to meet the rapidly growing demand for  SiC-based solutions,” says Simon Keeton, executive VP  & general manager Power Solutions Group at onsemi. “Full control  over our SiC manufacturing supply chain  and the market-leading efficiency of our products underscore onsemi’s  progress.”
