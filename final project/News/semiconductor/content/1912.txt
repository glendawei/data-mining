Vector Photonics’ principle development engineer presents paper at ECOC In the 8th International Symposium for Optical Interconnect in Data Centres  at the European Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC 2022) in  Basel, Switzerland (19–21 September), Dr Calum Hill, principle  development engineer at Vector Photonics Ltd  of Glasgow, Scotland, UK, gave an invited talk on 21 September on ‘PCSELs  at multiple wavelengths for high-bandwidth communications’. Vector Photonics says that the invitation to present is a  testament to the importance that its all-semiconductor PCSELs (photonic crystal  surface-emitting lasers) can play in resolving many of the challenges faced by  the datacoms industry as bandwidth requirements increase – namely power consumption,  latency, physical connection size and costs. Senior executives from  companies such as NVIDIA, ADVA, Infinera, Huawei, BT and IBM presented alongside  Vector Photonics, as well as numerous universities from around the world. “Hyperscale data centers require at least 800Gbs data transmission  interconnects to keep up with growing demand for cloud services,” says Hill.  “This is at the limit of current pluggable optics technology. Vector Photonics’  PCSELs more easily enable co-packaged optics solutions, where the optical  functionality is integrated onto the ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)  to improve overall system performance, whilst reducing system energy  consumption and cost,” he adds. “The CW (continuous wave) PCSELs, required for these  bandwidths, operate in the O-band as a high-power seed laser for multiple data channels,”  continues Hill. “Their surface emission gives far better power scaling and  beam divergence than conventional solutions, as well as simpler silicon  photonics fabrication. Furthermore, the structure of a PCSEL is not dependent  on the base epitaxy used, allowing PCSELs to be made at multiple different  wavelengths for different communication needs.”
