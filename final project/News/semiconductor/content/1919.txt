III-V Epi produces InP-based telecoms laser structures for University of Surrey III-V Epi Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK — which  provides a fast-turnaround molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) service for custom  compound semiconductor wafer design, manufacturing, test and  characterization — has  produced experimental telecoms laser structures targeting temperature-insensitive  operation. The epitaxy development was for the University of Surrey, funded by  a UK Engineering and Physical Sciences  Research Council (EPSRC)  Impact Acceleration Account. “The team at III-V Epi is helping us to develop robust and  practical indium phosphide  (InP)-based epitaxial wafers for telecoms lasers that eliminate the need for  expensive, energy-hungry cooling systems,” says lead researcher professor Stephen Sweeney at the University of  Surrey, who is managing the project. “III-V Epi  provided design and engineering expertise in the choice of material systems and  manufacturability, which informed our design simulations,” he adds. “III-V Epi  went on to produce wafers by MOCVD for the university to process, test and  further optimize. The resulting lasers will be a breakthrough in the industry,  with this development enabled by III-V Epi’s  world-class service and expertise.” The University of Surrey is one of 36 institutions with an EPSRC  Impact Acceleration Account, which provides rapid access to funds from UK  Research and Innovation (UKRI) for knowledge exchange, innovation and impact –  such as proof-of-concept, commercialization and market validation projects of  this type.
