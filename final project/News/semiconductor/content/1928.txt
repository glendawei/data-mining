POET participating in  multiple sessions at ECOC 2022 POET Technologies Inc of Toronto,  Ontario, Canada — a designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the data-center and telecom  markets — says that representatives from the firm will participate at  the European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC 2022) in  Basel, Switzerland (18–22 September), while the company is also exhibiting  in booth 578. On 22 September in the session ‘Non-Linear Devices and  Packaging’ at 10:45am CEST, principal engineer Dr Simon Goh is  presenting a paper on the passive alignment of lasers on the POET  Optical Interposer. 
  A concurrent symposium ‘Hybrid Integration of III-V Devices  with Silicon-based Waveguides (Si, SiN, SiO2)’ is co-organized by POET technical staff  member Dr Lucas Soldano. Chairman & CEO Dr Suresh Venkatesan is  also a participating speaker. Additionally, on 20 September (at 2pm CEST) Dr Michal  Lipson, professor of physics at Columbia University and a nominee to POET’s  board of directors, is leading a tutorial ‘The State of the Art and Challenges  of Silicon Photonics Today’. “Hybrid Integration is one of the critical and important topics of  discussion among professionals in the photonics industry today,” says  Venkatesan. “It is widely understood that neither conventional discrete  assembly nor conventional silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs)  are up to the challenges of scalability in volume, cost and power consumption  that are required for increasing speeds and bandwidth in data and  telecommunications, much less the high-volume applications for photonics in  optical computing, wearables and automotive LiDAR [light detection &  ranging],” he adds. “We recognized these challenges years ago, which is why the  POET Optical Interposer is the only true hybrid wafer-level, chip-scale  platform that integrates electronic and photonic devices in a fully CMOS-compatible  assembly process that meet these challenges and is available today to companies  that need integration solutions.”
