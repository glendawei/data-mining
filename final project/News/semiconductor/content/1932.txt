Coherent launches I-Temp micro-pump lasers Coherent Corp of Saxonburg, PA, USA, which  provides photonics technology for communications and aerospace & defense  applications, has launched its  I-Temp micro-pump lasers for extended ambient temperature operation in  broadband optical access networks. The growing demand for broadband services is bringing fiber-optic  networks closer to subscribers, with environmentally hardened equipment  deployed in uncontrolled ambient environments where space is constrained and  the availability of power is strictly limited, notes the firm. Coherent’s new  I-Temp micro-pump lasers are now capable of operating over the extended temperature  range of -40°C to 85°C, enabling optical amplifiers deployed at the  network edge to withstand extreme weather conditions. “The combination of small size, wide operating temperature, and  low power consumption makes the  I-Temp micro-pump a perfect solution for environmentally hardened optical  amplifiers installed, for example, on utility poles,” says Dr Richard Smart, senior VP, ROADM business unit. “The I-Temp micro-pump leverages differentiated  technology at every level of its vertically integrated design, including our  gallium arsenide (GaAs)  semiconductor laser technology platform, with its proven reliability through  decades of field deployments.” The I-Temp micro-pumps maintain a steady output power of 400mW  with less than 2W of power consumption and remain optimally wavelength-locked  with a fiber Bragg grating, without  the need for an internal cooler. They are available with 80μm PM980  polarization-maintaining fibers and 125μm HI 1060  bend-insensitive single-mode fibers. Coherent is exhibiting in booth #1 at the European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC 2022)  in Basel, Switzerland (19–21 September), showcasing the most recent  additions to its portfolio of solutions for telecom and datacom optical  networks.
