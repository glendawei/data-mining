Seoul Semiconductor alleges infringement of 12 LED patents by Feit South Korean LED maker Seoul  Semiconductor Co Ltd  has filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court  for the Central District of California against the USA’s largest light bulb maker Feit Electronic, asserting  that Feit lighting products infringe 12 LED patents,  and seeking a permanent injunction against the sales of those products. Previously, in the Eastern District  of Texas in 2019 and the Central District of California in 2020, Seoul  Semiconductor secured permanent injunctions against several retailers selling  Feit products. However, the distribution of suspected infringing products has  continued. For that reason, in 2022 Seoul filed a patent infringement lawsuit  against a Feit distributor Ace Hardware, as well as a patent infringement  lawsuit directly against Feit, to cut off the distribution of products believed  to be infringing Seoul’s patents. Seoul notes that it has a history of continually pursuing  companies that infringe its patents. Based on Seoul’s enforcement, in 2018-2019  the German District Court of  Düsseldorf ordered multiple permanent injunctions and a recall of LED products  made by Taiwanese LED package maker Everlight Electronics (the world’s eighth  largest LED maker). In June, Suwon  District Court in Korea found  Everlight guilty of criminal misappropriation of Seoul’s trade secrets and industry technology, awarding  the maximum criminal fines. Seoul also prevailed in six-year litigation against Enplas Corp, the largest backlight unit (BLU) lens maker, when the US District Court  for the Northern District of California ruled that Enplas willfully infringed  Seoul’s LED patent, and the US Supreme Court  affirmed Seoul’s victory in 2019. Civil damages by Enplas are still pending in  another litigation.
