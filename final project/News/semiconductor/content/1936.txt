Live demo at ECOC of Ayar’s SuperNova  multi-wavelength optical source leveraging Sivers’ CW-WDM-compliant DFB  laser array Sivers Semiconductors AB of Kista, Sweden  (which supplies chips and integrated modules) says that its subsidiary Sivers  Photonics (formerly CST Global of Glasgow, Scotland, UK) will be present in booth 616 at the European  Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC 2022) at Basel Congress Centre, Switzerland (19–21 September). A joint live demonstration will showcase Sivers Photonics’  8-wavelength distributed feedback (DFB) laser array integrated into the SuperNova  multi-wavelength optical source of  Ayar Labs of Santa Clara, CA, USA, whose integrated optical I/Os are targeted at  artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, high-performance computing (HPC), 5G  and light detection & ranging (LiDAR). Teams from Sivers Photonics  and Ayar Labs will be available throughout the event to take attendees  through the live demonstration. As founding and promoter members of the Continuous-Wave Wavelength Division Multiplexing Multi-Source Agreement  (CW-WDM MSA), the solutions from Sivers Photonics and Ayar Labs are both fully MSA compliant.  Established in 2020, the CW-WDM MSA was formed to standardize WDM CW sources in  O-band for emerging advanced integrated optics  applications that are expected to move to 8, 16 and 32 wavelengths. Such higher  wavelength counts are needed for emerging  applications such as AI, high performance computing and  high-density optics, and enable a leap in performance, efficiency, cost and  bandwidth scaling compared with previous technology  generations. The silicon photonic die market is forecasted to grow  to $1.1bn by 2026, according to the ‘Silicon Photonics, Market and  Technology Report 2021’ by Yole Dévelopment. In addition, on the  Market Focus stage in the exhibition  area (at 2.05pm, 19 September), Sivers Photonics’ chief technology officer Andrew McKee is  presenting the talk ‘Advanced InP DFB Laser Sources for Silicon Photonics Hybrid  Integration’.
