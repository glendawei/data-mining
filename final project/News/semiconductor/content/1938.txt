EPC opens motor drive design application center in Italy Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes enhancement-mode  gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors  (FETs) and integrated circuits for power management applications – has opened a new design application center  near Turin, Italy, to  focus on growing motor drive applications based on GaN technology in the  e-mobility, robotics, drone and industrial automation markets. The specialist  team will support customers in accelerating their design cycles and define future ICs for power management with state-of-the art  equipment to test applications from 400W to 10s of kW. Strategically located, Turin has a historical tradition in electric motors and motor drives, enabling the firm  to draw on the local technical talent. EPC says that its engineers are helping customers to reduce their  design cycle times and adopt GaN for  more efficient, smaller, lower-cost systems. Moreover, the center is exploring  ways to exploit the potential of EPC’s GaN technology in motor drive applications to enable a  substantial increase in the efficiency of the motor, leading to  higher-power-density designs than what has been possible with historically  MOSFET-based designs. Turin also  features the Power Electronics  Innovation Centre, a  cross-department entity in the Politecnico di Torino, and  EPC is collaborating closely with PEIC by investing in shared research and  development. “Our new facility  combines a comprehensive GaN product portfolio and design expertise offering  customers a center of excellence that is unrivalled for motor drive applications,” says new facility’s  head, EPC’s director of motor systems and applications Marco Palma. “Its  location is key too, as Europe is driving the green revolution in the  e-mobility market, by using the Euro 7  standard in the short term and by banning internal combustion engines by 2035.  This is definitely the right time to invest in higher-power-density motor  solutions that avoid unnecessary energy waste.”
