Aixtron launches G10-SiC  200mm CVD system At the 19th International Conference on  Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM) in Davos, Switzerland, deposition equipment  maker Aixtron SE of  Herzogenrath, near Aachen, Germany has launched the G10-SiC high-temperature  chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system for high-volume manufacturing of  the latest-generation silicon carbide (SiC) power devices on  150/200mm SiC wafers. The G10-SiC system is built on the firm’s  established G5 WW C 150mm platform and provides a  flexible dual-wafer size configuration of 9x150mm and 6x200mm, which is  reckoned to be instrumental for the transition of the SiC industry from 150mm  (6-inch) to 200mm (8-inch) wafer diameter. The new platform is built around the  firm’s proven automated wafer cassette-to-cassette loading solution with  high-temperature wafer transfer.  Combined with high-growth-rate process capabilities, the G10‑SiC provides what  is claimed to be best-in-class wafer throughput and throughput per square meter to efficiently use the limited  cleanroom space available in  semiconductor fabs.
