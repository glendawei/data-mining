Tagore launches antenna-tuning SP4T RF switch  with 100V peak RF voltage and 1Ω  on-resistance Fabless semiconductor company Tagore  Technology Inc – which was founded in 2011 and has design centers  in Arlington Heights, IL, USA and Kolkata, India developing  gallium nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) technology for RF and  power management applications – has launched the feature-rich TS63421K antenna-tuning  switch, which is claimed to offer best-in-class insertion loss, power handling  and harmonic performance, and is suitable for filter and antenna tuning,  dynamic matching in private radio access points, and public safety equipment. Designed with Tagore’s second-generation gallium nitride on  silicon carbide (GaN-SiC) process, the new TS63421K reflective open  single-pole four-throw (SP4T) switch is suitable for antenna or filter  tuning applications where high RF peak voltage handling is desired. The device  offers what is claimed to be the industry’s lowest on-resistance (Ron) of 1Ω and off-capacitance of 0.2pf and  can handle peak RF voltage of 100V. The RF switch is configured as a  four-throw output that can be independently controlled and, therefore, can have  16 different states or tuning values. “This GaN-SiC SP4T device is great for antenna tuning applications  with antenna optimization to improve efficiency, resulting in higher overall  performance compared to our first-generation product,” says chief sales &  marketing officer Klaus Buehring. “This improved  efficiency results in higher data throughput, increased battery life  and a longer range for fewer dropped calls.” The TS63421K is available in a 3x3-QFN plastic package and  requires no external components, making it suitable for low-SWaP applications.  The new antenna tuning RF switch is compatible with existing  products, allowing customers to enhance radio performance by switching to the  latest version of the second-generation product.
