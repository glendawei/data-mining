II-VI changes name to Coherent Corp and launches new brand identity Engineered materials and optoelectronic component  maker II-VI Inc of Saxonburg, PA, USA has announced the change  of its corporate name to Coherent Corp as well as a new brand  identity, after completing its acquisition on 1 July of Coherent Inc  of Santa Clara, CA (which provides  lasers and laser-based technology for scientific, commercial and industrial  applications). “We chose the name Coherent because it has the universal meaning  of ‘bringing things together’, and an appeal that we believe will expand our  brand recognition and ultimately lead to value creation,” says Dr Vincent  D. Mattera Jr, chair & CEO of Coherent Corp. “The broader  meaning of the word coherent represents our diversity in thinking distilled  into our clarity of purpose, our unity in action, and our broader sense of  engagement by connection to our mission, vision, and values.” The new brand identity includes a new corporate logo that  represents the atom, which is “foundational to what makes our products  possible”. The new name and brand identity reflect the combined company’s  strong heritage and long history while signaling a broadened scope and vision  for the future, the firm adds. The organization will maintain II-VI’s founding  date of 1971 and its founding place and corporate headquarters as Saxonburg,  Pennsylvania. While the new corporate name and logo take effect immediately, the  pre-merger companies’ existing websites, social media platforms, and most  product branding will continue for the near term as the transition to the new  brand identity is executed over the coming months.
