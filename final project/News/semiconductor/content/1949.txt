Optically pumped yellow InGaN edge-emitting laser University of California Santa Barbara  (UCSB) in the USA claims the first report of optically pumped 568nm yellow  lasing from a high-crystal-quality indium gallium nitride (InGaN)  quantum well (QW) edge-emitting structure grown on bulk GaN substrate [Panpan Li et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v121, p071103, 2022]. The researchers comment: “Even though, in  practice, electrically injected laser diodes have broader  applications and impacts, an optically pumped device is undoubtedly a good  indicator that the material quality is competent for future development and can  be well regarded as a precursor to electrically injected laser diodes.” Yellow lasing is quite difficult in  general, depending on frequency conversion in gas, ion or dye media. Such  methods tend to be bulky, expensive and inefficient. Use for yellow laser light  has been found in advanced biology and astrophysics/astronomy studies. The problems for generating yellow light  from InGaN include the large lattice mismatch between GaN and high-indium-content  InGaN and inconvenient electric fields arising from differing charge  polarization of the various III-nitride bonds. In laser structures, there is  the additional problem of arranging suitable confinement of the optical mode to  enable stimulated emission. The UCSB team points to the aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN)  cladding that is often used being problematic in the yellow range due to the  thickness required going beyond the critical thickness, after which the  material relaxes by cracking. The laser material was grown by  atmospheric-pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on  c-plane bulk GaN (Figure 1). The yellow light was generated by  high-indium-content InGaN multiple QWs (MQWs) separated by  AlGaN/GaN barriers.  Figure 1: Epitaxial structure.
