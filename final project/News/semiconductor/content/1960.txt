Lumileds says LUXEON HL1Z outperforms seemingly brighter competitors in application LED maker Lumileds LLC of San Jose, CA,  USA says that data sheets have long been the go-to source  for LED specifications and are broadly used to narrow options and ultimately  select an LED for a particular application. But, too often, factors not  accounted for in the data sheet  significantly affect the LED’s performance in the application, and, in some  cases, relying on data-sheet specifications alone will lead to the wrong  conclusion. As an example, Lumileds cites that its newest high-power LED (LUXEON  HL1Z) was evaluated against a competitor’s offering for a recent customer  developing a 25° spot application. When  mounted on a board, the competitor’s LED appeared to be the best choice in  terms of output and intensity. However, when implemented in the application,  the LUXEON HL1Z outperformed in lumens by more than 20% and more than 40% in terms  of candela (intensity) – see Table.  Lumileds says that the result highlights the importance of  understanding the end objective and  the factors that may influence the outcome. The LUXEON HL1Z is very small, allowing  tight alignment of the LEDs and hence creating a smaller light-emitting area.  This, coupled with collection efficiency and collimating efficiency of the  fixture, produce a result where the LUXEON HL1Z does deliver the best  performance even though, at a data-sheet level, performance appears lower. Though only launched in May, Lumileds has released additional  options with varying correlated color temperatures  and color-rendering indexes (CCT/CRI), growing the LUXEON HL1Z portfolio to 15  options. At just 1.4mm per side and  only 0.36mm high, the emitter is very small, and at 4000K/80CRI and 350mA  offers 133lm and 136lm/W with excellent color-over-angle performance, says the  firm.
