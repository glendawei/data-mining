Smartphone shipments to fall 6.5% in 2022, amidst global inflation and softer demand Due to  record-breaking inflation, geopolitical tensions and other macroeconomic  challenges that have significantly dampened consumer demand, shipments of  smartphones will decline by 6.5% to 1.27 billion units in 2022, according  to the latest International Data Corp (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly  Mobile Phone Tracker forecast. As a result, the latest forecast figures  represent a reduction of three percentage points from previous  projections. However, IDC expects the setback to be short term and the market  to rebound in 2023 with 5.2% growth year-over-year and, in the long term, a five-year  compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.4%. “The supply constraints pulling down on the market since last year  have eased and the industry has shifted to a demand-constrained market,” says  Nabila Popal, research director with IDC’s Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device  Trackers. “High inventory in channels and low demand with no signs of immediate  recovery has OEMs panicking and cutting their orders drastically for 2022. The  events of the last 12 months have shaved 150 million units off the  market for 2022 from our forecast in the second quarter of 2021,”she adds.  “Despite the unit decline, average selling prices (ASPs) have grown 10%  year-over-year in Q2 and are forecast to grow 6.3% for the full year. The  premium segment ($800+) has proved resilient to the economic turmoil and has  grown four percentage points in share to 16% of the total smartphone  market and will continue to grow. This includes foldable devices, which is the  fastest-growing segment today and expected to increase 70% year-over-year in 2022  to reach 13.5 million units shipped.” From a regional view, the economic crisis has hit emerging markets  (where a majority of the shipment volume comes from sub-$400 devices)  significantly harder. Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is expected to be down  17.4% in 2022 and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan and China) (APeJC, previously  forecast to grow 3%) is now expected to drop by 4.5% in 2022. However, the most  significant volume drop is by China, which is now forecast to decline by 12.5%  or roughly 41 million units, contributing almost half of the overall  reduction this year. In contrast, developed markets like North America  (USA and Canada) and Western Europe are forecast to do much better in  2022. The USA will be relatively flat at 0.3% growth year-over-year, while the  Canadian market will fare slightly better with 3.2% growth, and Western Europe  will decline only slightly by 0.7%.  Picture:   IDC’s 2020-2026 worldwide smartphone  forecast, including shipments by air-interface generation (3G, 4G and 5G) and  average selling price for 4G and 5G phones. Global shipments of 5G devices are expected to grow 23.6%  year-over-year in 2022 and account for over half (54%) of all shipments with  688 million devices and an ASP of $616. In the long term, 5G is projected  to reach a volume share of 79% in 2026 with an ASP of $444. In contrast, the 4G  ASP will hit $176 in 2022, dropping to $106 by the end of the forecast period.  As a result, the overall smartphone ASP will decline from $413 in 2022 to $373  in 2026. “The resilience of the market’s upper echelon has been a testament  to the success of iOS, which has not witnessed a full-year shipment decline  since 2019,” notes Anthony Scarsella, research director with IDC’s  Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers. “Despite the overall  market decline, iOS shipments will remain positive in 2022 with 0.5% growth.  Additionally, the operating system will display minimal growth throughout the  forecast period, with ASPs hovering well above $950,” he adds. “As for the  world’s most popular operating system, Android, 2022 will bring a near 8%  decline but will rebound nicely in 2023 with 6.2% growth. Unfortunately, the  low-end of the market has not fared well in 2022, as shipments of Android-based  devices under $200 declined 22.4% in Q1 and 16.5% in Q2. On a positive note,  devices above $1000 have displayed 35.2% growth, thanks to premium flagships  and the recent success of foldable devices in the market.”
