Room-temperature CW InGaAs 980nm laser diodes on on-axis silicon China’s Beijing University of Posts and  Telecommunications has demonstrated room-temperature continuous wave (RT-CW) operation of 980nm indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) quantum well (QW) laser diodes (LDs)  directly grown on on-axis silicon (Si) (001) [Chen Jiang  et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v121, p061102, 2022]. The team comments: “RT-CW operation of  silicon-based GaAs-buffered III–V  QW lasers directly grown on on-axis Si (001) substrates has not been realized  until now.” It is hoped that such directly integrated  devices could reduce the costs of optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs) fabricated on silicon platforms through eased mass production, compared with using external light sources or wafer bonding of III-V light emitters. Barriers to heteroepitaxy of III-V  materials on silicon include crystal defects such as threading dislocations  (TDs), antiphase domains (APDs), and micro-cracks. These defects tend to  seriously reduce the optoelectronic performance of III-V structures. One way to reduce the impact of TDs on  performance is to use quantum dots rather than  QWs. However, the implementation of QWs on silicon is attractive since it would  allow the transfer of the vast engineering knowledge from commercial  light-emitting devices grown on III-V substrates to the silicon platform.
