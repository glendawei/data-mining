OIPT’s silicon carbide plasma epi-prep alternative to CMP validated After announcing its plasma alternative to chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP), Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology (OIPT) of Yatton, near  Bristol, UK says that its non-contact plasma etch method of preparing silicon carbide substrates for epitaxy delivers comparable results  to CMP but with lower operating expenditure  (OPEX), higher device yield and a  process window capable of supporting  the transition to thinner wafers and therefore increasing wafers per boule. The feasibility project, carried out at a tier 1 SiC semiconductor manufacturing fab  using whole wafers, found that performance of the new plasma substrate preparation technique is already  equivalent to CMP for epitaxy readiness. “This validation outcome is a significant milestone in our goal of  creating a more cost-effective and sustainable technique for preparing SiC  substrates for epitaxy,” says Klaas Wisniewski, Plasma Technology’s strategic business development director. “Our plasma epi-prep technology is  hugely promising and currently compares favourably to existing alternatives,  but has the potential to exponentially increase substrate production and meet  the growing demand for SiC substrates in high-growth markets,” he adds. Oxford Instruments is formally launching its plasma epi-prep  solution at the International Conference on Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM/ECSCRM) in Davos, Switzerland  (11-16 September). In the conference  technical sessions, it will present its latest whole-wafer epi and device  results utilizing its patented dry etch  process. There is also an opportunity to speak in person at the event to  discuss implementing plasma epi-prep in high-volume manufacturing fabs.
