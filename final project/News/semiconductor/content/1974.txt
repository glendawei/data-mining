EVG expands collaboration with ITRI on heterogeneous integration process development EV Group of St Florian, Austria – a  supplier of wafer bonding and lithography equipment for semiconductor,  micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology applications – has expanded its collaboration with the  Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Hsinchu, Taiwan on  developing advanced heterogeneous integration processes. With the support of Taiwan’s Department of Industrial Technology  (DoIT) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), ITRI established the  Heterogeneous Integration Chip-let System Package Alliance (Hi-CHIP) to help  create an ecosystem covering package design, testing and verification, and  pilot production, to achieve the goal of supply chain localization and  expand business opportunities. As a member of the Hi-CHIP Alliance, EVG has  provided several of its most advanced wafer bonding and lithography  systems, including the LITHOSCALE maskless exposure lithography system,  EVG850 DB automated debonding system, and GEMINI FB hybrid bonding  system. The installation of these high-volume-manufacturing platforms at ITRI’s  facility should help enable EVG’s and ITRI’s shared customers to accelerate the  development and transfer of new heterogeneous integration processes from  R&D to customers’ fabs. In semiconductor manufacturing, 3D vertical stacking and  heterogeneous integration – the manufacturing, assembly and packaging of  multiple different components and dies into a single device or package – are  increasingly important for higher performance beyond transistor scaling. 3D and  heterogeneous integration are enabling high-bandwidth interconnects in advanced  packaging to achieve overall system performance gains, and thus have become a  crucial driver for artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving and  other high-performance computing applications. As a result, the MOEA is proactively  following up and bridging the resources with national-scale R&D projects  such as ‘AI Chip Heterogeneous Integrated Module Advanced Manufacturing  Platform’ and ‘Programmable Heterogeneous 3D Integration’. “As part of ITRI’s mission to drive industrial development, create  economic value, and enhance social well-being through technology R&D, we  focused on developing new 3D and heterogeneous chip integration processes and  forging close cooperation across the supply chain to enable continued  development and growth of the semiconductor industry,” says Dr Robert  (Wei-Chung) Lo, deputy general director of Electronic and Optoelectronic  System Research Laboratories at ITRI. “Having the same fully automated  high-volume-manufacturing systems in our research facility that our customers  have in their fabs, including these new wafer bonding and lithography  solutions from EV Group, enables our customers to immediately transfer  process recipes developed at ITRI to their own fabs – providing short ramp-up  time from lab to fab,” he adds. “Key to our Triple-i philosophy of invent-innovate-implement is  our focus on engaging with world-leading research institutes, like ITRI, to  accelerate the development and commercialization of new technologies that drive  future innovations in the semiconductor industry,” says Hermann Waltl,  executive sales & customer support director and member of the  executive board at EVG. “Our ongoing collaboration with ITRI gives us access to  world-class research expertise and further enhances our process support  infrastructure in Taiwan, which EVG has significantly expanded over the years  to better meet the growing needs and challenges that our customers and partners  in the region face. This includes our exceptional process and application  engineering team based in multiple locations across Taiwan, which complements  the services provided at EVG’s Heterogeneous Integration Competence Center at  our headquarters in Austria.”
