Tagore launches dual-channel ultra-low-noise amplifier with integrated RF switch Fabless semiconductor company Tagore Technology Inc –  which was founded in January 2011 and has design centers in Arlington Heights, IL, USA and Kolkata, India developing gallium nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) technology for RF and  power management applications – has  launched the TSL8329M, a dual-channel low-noise amplifier (LNA) with an  integrated RF switch. Designed for demanding applications, the multi-chip  module operates from 3.3GHz to 4.2GHz. Architected with cascading, two-stage  LNA and a high-power GaN-based fail-safe RF switch, the TSL8329M is suited  to applications in 5G infrastructure and TDD mMIMO (massive multiple-input-multiple-output) systems. “With integrated dual-channel RF front end, the high  performance TSL8329M is well suited for the most demanding 5G infrastructure  radios, small cells and massive MIMO system,” says chief marketing officer  Klaus Buehring. “The footprint and pinouts allow  easy adaption in complex MIMO configurations.” The TSL8329M has an NF of 1dB with 32dB of gain at 3.6GHz with an  output third-order intercept point (OIP3) of 35dBm. In bypass mode, the LNA  provides 13dB of gain. In power-down mode, the device draws 5mA. In transmit  operation, when RF inputs are connected to a termination pin (TERM-CHA or  TERM-CHB), the switch provides a low insertion loss of 0.45dB at 3.6GHz  and handles LTE average power (9dB peak-to-average ratio (PAR)) of 43dBm for  full lifetime operation. The device comes in a RoHS-compliant, compact, 6mm x 6mm,  40-lead LFCSP.
