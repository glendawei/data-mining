MOCVD Ohmic InGaN tunnel junction growth North Carolina State University (NCSU) in the USA has reported progress in  creating metal-organic chemical vapor deposition  (MOCVD) indium gallium nitride (InGaN) tunnel junctions (TJs)  with Ohmic conduction in the forward and reverse directions [B. G. Hagar et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., p121, p052104,2022].  The team comments : “We are not aware of any previous MOCVD-grown III-nitride  TJs that display linear conduction in both forward and reverse biases.” While  better TJ behavior is seen in molecular beam epitaxy structures, MOCVD is preferred in manufacturing. Tunnel junctions have been proposed as  solutions to various problems of III-nitride (and other) semiconductor devices  such as multi-color light-emitting diode (LED) and multi-junction solar cell (MJSC) structures. The NCSU team suggests that its achievement  could be due mainly to the combination of three factors: a constant magnesium  (Mg) concentration across the p/n layers allowed abrupt electron and hole  concentrations at the junction interface; a constant Mg concentration reduced  Mg diffusion, avoiding smudging of the junction; and Mg doping on the n side of  the TJ created deep levels within the bandgap that enhances tunneling under  forward-biased conditions.
