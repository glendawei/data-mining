Everlight convicted for misappropriating Seoul Semi’s trade secrets and technology South Korean LED maker Seoul  Semiconductor Co Ltd says that the Korean Suwon District Court  Appellate Division has found Taiwan-based  Everlight Electronics Co Ltd guilty of criminal  misappropriation of its trade secrets  and industry technology. The court awarded criminal fines against Everlight – the maximum  fine so far for a foreign company for the commission of such a crime. Three  former employees of Seoul Semiconductor who left the company and went to work  at Everlight were also sentenced to 1-2 years  in prison, with 2-3 years of  probation for trade secret and  technology misappropriation. The Korea Prosecutors’ Office criminally indicted Everlight,  together with Seoul’s former employees, for criminal misappropriation of  Seoul’s trade secrets and industry technology. The lower court convicted Everlight on a charge of criminal  misappropriation of trade secrets, and the appellate court affirmed the lower court’s decision and also upheld a  charge of criminal misappropriation of Seoul’s industry technology by  Everlight. 
        Seoul Semiconductor alleges that  some global companies still purchase cheaper copycat products that  infringe its technology and sell those products under their branding, despite  claiming their environmental, social and  governance (ESG) compliance. “Intellectual property is the only tool that enables small  businesses and entrepreneurs to survive and grow,” says Seoul Semiconductor’s  founder Chung Hoon Lee. “Companies stealing such hard-earned technology should  be expelled from the market,” he adds.
