Veeco grows revenue 4.9% in Q2, despite supply chain constraints For second-quarter  2022, epitaxial deposition and process equipment maker  Veeco Instruments Inc of Plainview, NY, USA has reported revenue of $164m (above  the midpoint of its $150-170m guidance). This is up 4.9% on $156.4m last  quarter and 12% on $146.3m a year ago, despite revenue being impacted by some  demand not being able to be fulfilled due to supply chain constraints. Growth was driven by the  Semiconductor sector (Front-End and Back-End, as well as EUV  Mask Blank systems and Advanced Packaging) reaching another  record of $97.5m (59.5% of total revenue). This is up 25.6% on $77.6m last  quarter and 81.6% on $53.7m a year ago, due to significant contributions from  laser annealing and advanced packaging lithography systems. “Demand  is stemming predominantly from advanced- and trailing-node logic applications  [artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), as well as  mature automotive and consumer applications], where Veeco’s semiconductor  exposure is greatest,” notes CEO Bill Miller. The Compound Semiconductor  sector (Power Electronics, RF Filter & Device  applications, and Photonics including specialty, mini- and micro-LEDs, VCSELs,  laser diodes) contributed $31.1m (19% of total revenue). This is down 16.2% from $37.1m  last quarter (due to a slowdown in 5G RF-related activity) but up 28.5% on $24.2m  a year ago (driven by systems shipments for photonics applications). “We  shipped multiple deposition systems to support laser diodes for optical communication and  specialty LED production,” notes Miller. Data Storage contributed  $21.5m (13.1% of total revenue), more than halving from $52m a year ago but roughly  level with $21.6m last quarter. The Scientific &  Other segment contributed $13.8m (8.4% of total revenue), down 31.3% on $20.1m  last quarter and 15.9% on $16.4m a year ago. By region, the USA comprised  35% of total revenue (driven primarily by sales of laser annealing and  advanced packaging lithography systems). The Asia-Pacific region (excluding China)  comprised 30% (driven mainly by Semiconductor system sales). Europe, Middle-East & Africa (EMEA) comprised 17% of  total revenue. China comprised 17% of total revenue (primarily for photonics  applications).  On a non-GAAP basis, gross  margin was 40.3%, down from 43.1% last quarter and 41.6% a year ago. This was  due to an unfavorable product mix (since two of the  three evaluation tools that were signed-during the quarter were offered with  especially low pricing). “We expect gross margins to improve in the second half compared to Q2,” notes chief  financial officer John Kiernan. Operating expenses have  risen further, from $39.6m a year ago and $42.8m last quarter to $43.2m, although  this is below the expected $44-46m. Operating income was $23m,  down from $24.7m last quarter but up on $21.3m a year ago (and exceeding the  guidance of $15-22m). Net income was $20m  ($0.35 per diluted share), down from $21.7m ($0.38 per diluted share) last  quarter but up from $17.9m ($0.35 per diluted share) a year ago, and exceeding  the guidance of $12-19m ($0.22-0.34 per diluted share). Cash flow from  operations was $3.4m. Capital expenditure (CapEx) was $4.5m. During the  quarter, cash and short-term investments hence fell only slightly, from $232m  to $231m. Long-term debt, including the current portion of $20m, was recorded  at $274m on the balance sheet and represents the carrying value about $278m in  convertible notes. “We’re experiencing  success with the investments we’ve made in our evaluation program, as  demonstrated by the continued adoption of our technologies by leading customers,”  says Miller. “We’re working to  penetrate the compound semiconductor market  with our MOCVD solutions by targeting micro-LED and power electronics applications. Our gallium nitride and arsenide-phosphide systems  are in the field under evaluation with leading customers,” he adds. “In the power  electronics case, we’re working with a foundry customer who is evaluating our Propel  single-wafer gallium nitride system for  8-inch power applications. We believe there are opportunities in the consumer,  automotive and data-center power markets to enable improved cost of ownership.” “In micro-LED, we’re  engaged in two applications working with a number of leaders in the industry  for five-plus years. The first approach is more traditional, where red, green  and blue micro-LEDs are produced independently and transferred to a display. We  have our aluminium arsenide phosphide system under evaluation for  red micro-LED opportunities. We expect this evaluation to close in the second  half of this year. For the second approach, we have 200mm and 300mm gallium nitride systems that we’re deploying  for an innovative micro-LED application where the blue, green and red pixels  are produced on the same silicon wafer. Both approaches can potentially be a  good long-term opportunity for the company going forward,” believes Miller. “While our demand is  quite strong, we’ve not seen a meaningful improvement in inbound material lead times,” notes Kiernan. In this constrained supply chain environment, for third-quarter 2022 Veeco  expects revenue of $160-180m. Due to a more favorable product mix than in Q2, gross margin should improve to 41-43%. With operating  expenses of $45-47m, operating income should be $21-30m and net income $18-28m  ($0.32-0.48 per diluted share). With healthy order activity  (especially in the Semiconductor and Data Storage markets), demand  for Veeco’s products continues to outpace supply, leading to growing order  backlog, notes Veeco. “Our San Jose  facility ramp is on schedule, and our operations will be fully transferred to  the new building by the end of Q3,” says Miller. “The increased manufacturing  footprint is enabling the ramp of our laser annealing output to meet our customers demand. Demand for laser annealing remains healthy as we see  customers adopt our technology and add capacity, because our laser annealing platform is a production tool  of record at the world’s leading logic players,” he adds. “Beyond Q3/2022,  although supply-chain challenges persist, we continue to experience strong  demand for our products,” says Kiernan.  “We’re reiterating our previously guided full-year revenue range of $640-680m  and diluted non-GAAP EPS range of $1.50-1.70 per share.” By market segment,  Veeco expects year-on-year revenue growth of 50% in Semiconductors (to about  $370m), 20-25% in Compound Semiconductors (to $130m), and 10% in Scientific  & Other (to $70m, or just over 10% of total revenue). Data storage is  expected to fall by about 45% (to $90m). “We are excited to  introduce laser annealing to the memory market,” states Miller. “In fact, a  leading DRAM manufacturer recently signed-off their evaluation system for a  future node. We anticipate follow-on orders in the late 2023 or early 2024  timeframe to support our customers manufacturing plans. Overall, our laser  annealing business is growing as we win process steps and new customers,” he  concludes.
