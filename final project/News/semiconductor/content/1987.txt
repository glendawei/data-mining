BRC Solar selects EPC2218 100V eGaN FETs for solar power optimizer Efficient Power Conversion Corp  (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which  makes enhancement-mode gallium nitride  on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors (FETs) for power management applications – says that its EPC2218 100V FETs have been designed into the next-generation  M500/14 power optimizer of BRC Solar GmbH of Ettlingen Germany. This has enabled a higher current density  due to the low power dissipation and  the small size of the GaN FET making the critical load circuit more compact. The small parasitic capacitance  and inductance of the GaN FETs creates a clean switching performance, which allows good EMI behavior in the  field. Another benefit of the GaN FETs is the zero reverse recovery losses.
