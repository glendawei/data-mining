Ambrogio commences on  a part-time basis and may increase to full-time in-line with revenue generation  activity. A Chartered  Accountant, Ambrogio has more than two decades of experience leading finance  teams in high-growth public, private and not-for-profit enterprises. Ambrogio  has previously held CFO roles at ASX-listed investment company Gowing Bros Ltd,  employment and training firm MTC Australia Ltd, and Australian marketing agency Creative Activation.

His demonstrated track record in overseeing  business transformation and delivering significant shareholder value  complements Jim’s [BluGlass’ president Jim  Haden’s] expertise and will be critical as we transition BluGlass to  revenue generation,” he adds.
