Nanorod blue LED sidewall passivation Researcher based in South Korea have  developed a sol-gel sidewall passivation process for blue indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) nanorod light-emitting diodes (nLEDs) with enhanced  external quantum efficiency (EQE) over  plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition  (ALD) [Mihyang  Sheen et al, Nature, v608, p56, 2022]. Indeed, the team from Samsung Display,  Korea Institute of Energy Technology (KENTECH), Pusan National University, and  Samsung Electronics, claims that “the fabricated nLEDs showed an EQE of 20.2±0.6%, the highest EQE value  ever reported for the LED in the nanoscale”; and that the value “is higher than  the best EQE value of the μLED  structure even at a larger size.” The researcher believe that their work will  accelerate the implementation of nLEDs in next-generation displays. Other  potential benefits could be seen in solid-state lighting, optical data  communication and photonic deployments, along with high-pixel-density display  applications such as augmented/extended reality, which can be difficult to realize with liquid crystal technology. Sidewall passivation becomes increasingly  critical as device dimensions reduce since the surface area/volume ratio increases. Without suitable passivation, the EQE  decreases through non-radiative electron-hole recombination at sidewall  defects. The material used for the nLEDs consisted  of 8x(InGaN/GaN) multiple quantum wells (MQWs)  between p- and n-GaN layers grown on 4-inch c-plane sapphire using metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The  structure also included a top layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductor. The 600nm-diameter nanorod structures were  fabricated using nanoimprint lithography, inductively coupled plasma etch, and potassium hydroxide wet etch to remove  surface damage. The wet etch also transforms the trapezoidal profile of the dry etched nanocolumn, giving more vertical sidewalls (Figure 1).
