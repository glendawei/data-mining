Unitemp supplies ESPEC fast-rate environmental test chamber to Warwick University Led by professor Phil Mawby, the Power Electronics  Applications and Technology in Energy Research (PEATER) team in the School  of Engineering at the UK’s Warwick University has installed and commissioned a  new ARS060680 fast rate environmental test chamber of Japan-based ESPEC,  supplied by specialist environmental engineering company Unitemp Ltd. As part of a suite of equipment funded through Driving the  Electric Revolution (DER) as part of its main  centers of expertise initiative, the new chamber will support  research and development on wide-bandgap semiconductor technologies in  power electronics machines and drives (PEMD). This tranche of equipment  augments a well-established cleanroom for die processing as well as an epitaxy  capability for silicon carbide (SiC). The new ARS 060680 ultra-fast-rate environmental stress  chamber has a temperature and humidity range of +10°C to +95°C/10% to 98%rh  with a refresh rate of 15K/min. It will be used to stress the semiconductors  and invertors specifically for automotive applications. “We wanted a chamber that provided us with maximum flexibility,  allowing us to undertake a multitude of tests including high- and  low-temperature storage, thermal cycling and temperature and humidity  stress  testing,” says Mawby. The emphasis at PEATER is to develop a facility for reliability  and testing of assembled power devices, modules and assemblies. Industry  already has access to these facilities and PEATER is providing both the  expertise and facilities to evaluate new ideas, assemblies and integrations for  use in the fast-growing automotive sector.
