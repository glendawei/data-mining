Seoul Semiconductor wins German injunction against Conrad South Korean LED maker Seoul  Semiconductor Co Ltd has obtained a permanent injunction in  patent litigation against European retailer Conrad Electronic for infringement  of an LED patent in Germany. In July, the German District Court of Manheim issued a permanent  injunction against certain cell phones and a recall of those products in  the patent litigation against Conrad. The accused products relate to flash LEDs  for cell phones. The patented technology in the cell-phone flash LEDs serves to  efficiently extract light emitted from the LED, significantly improving light  intensity and brightness. This patented technology has been widely used for  cell-phone flashlights, automobile headlamps, UV-LED home appliances,  horticulture applications, and outdoor lighting. Seoul has already won several patent litigations based on the  asserted patent. For example, in December 2018, the District Court of  DÃ¼sseldorf ordered a permanent injunction for patent infringement against  various LED products and a recall of those products. In addition, the German  Federal Court of Justice has declared the validity of this patent. Seoul and its affiliates have actively engaged in patent  enforcement against companies that use what it describes as cheap infringing  products despite claiming environmental, social  and governance (ESG)  compliance. In the past four years, as a result, Seoul has secured seven  judgments of permanent injunctions and orders of recall in Europe against  infringing products, including cell phones, lighting products, and UV-LED  home appliances.
