Navitas’ 160W ultra-fast charger powers OnePlus 10T smartphone Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA  and Dublin, Ireland says that  global mobile technology company OnePlus  has once again chosen GaNFast power ICs  to ultra-fast-charge its new flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 10T. The new OnePlus 10T features the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1  (4nm) chipset, a 120Hz FHD + AMOLED display screen, and 50MP main camera, with Cryo-Velocity Vapor cooling,  all driven by a 4800mAhr battery. The 150W-capable SUPERVOOC Endurance Edition delivers up to a day’s power  after just 10 minutes of charging,  with a full charge (from 1-100%) taking only 19 minutes. New York was the focus for the 10T’s debut, with a special launch  event at the Gotham Hall, and a  Navitas-OnePlus co-operative promotion on the Nasdaq Tower in Times Square. “From the 10R launched in July, to the 10T in August, and onwards  to future designs, we expect to continue our in-depth collaboration with  Navitas to deliver ultra-portable, ultra-fast user experiences,”  says OnePlus’ chief operating officer  Kinder Liu. GaNFast ICs integrate GaN power with drive, control, protection  and sensing to enable 3x faster charging with up to 40% energy savings in only half the size and weight  of legacy silicon solutions, it is reckoned. Using an NV6125 GaN IC for the high-frequency boost power factor correction (PFC), followed by  a high-frequency quasi-resonant (QR) flyback  converter, the 160W charger measures just 58mm x 57mm x 30mm (99cc) with power density over  1.6W/cc.
