Odyssey’s foundry revenue recovery in Q3 to offset cash used during product development Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies Inc of  Ithaca, NY, USA, which is developing high-voltage vertical power switching  components based on proprietary gallium nitride (GaN) processing  technology, has reported  revenue of just $20,581 for second-quarter 2022 (following just $29,938 in Q1),  down from $287,153 a year previously, with net loss remaining about $1.3m  ($0.10 per diluted share). “We expect a significant sequential revenue improvement in Q3/2022.  Our foundry revenue will be approximately $195,000 in the third quarter,” says CEO  Mark Davidson. “This revenue is generated from our foundry services, which  helps to offset our cash use while our products are being developed. We’re  focused on re-building our foundry services revenue to approximately $300,000  per quarter or better. Our  opportunity pipeline for foundry services has recently increased to  approximately the $2m level,” he adds. “Odyssey completed important technology development milestones in  Q2,” notes Davidson. “The team has made substantive progress in fabricating  vertical GaN power transistors for  high-performance and high-power conversion in key applications such as  industrial motors, electric vehicles, and renewable energy,” he adds. Technology  development and business milestones accomplished recently include the  following: “Our 1000+ volt  milestone further validates our approach to deliver industry-leading efficiency  with remarkably high switching frequencies  at lower price points than more  expensive alternatives, including silicon carbide,”  says Davidson. “Odyssey is on-track to build Gen1 engineering product samples in Q4/2022.”
