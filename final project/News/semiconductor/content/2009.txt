POET reports NRE revenue from multiple customers in Q2 For second-quarter 2022, POET Technologies Inc  of Toronto, Ontario, Canada — a designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer  and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the data-center and telecom  markets — has reported non-recurring  engineering revenue (NRE) of $120,261, compared with $209,100 a year ago and  nil last quarter. The firm provided services under an NRE contract to one  customer in 2021. In 2022, the firm is now providing similar services to  multiple customers, one of which continued to contract services from last year.  The revenue relates to unique projects that are being addressed utilizing the  capabilities of the POET Optical Interposer. Net loss was $5.283m ($0.14 per share), up from $4.408m ($0.13 per  share) a year ago but cut from $5.433m ($0.15 per share) last quarter. The net  loss included R&D costs of $1.8m. Also, the non-cash impact of the Super  Photonics Xiamen (SPX) joint venture with Sanan Integrated Circuit Co Ltd of  Xiamen City, Fujian province, China, was -$0.746m compared to nil a year  ago and -$0.43m last quarter. POET’s share of the operating loss in Super Photonics  is about 88.5% due to the high value of its initial contribution. Cash outflow from operating activities was -$3.3m, worse than  -$2.7m a year ago but an improvement on -$3.7m last quarter. POET ended Q2  with $13.8m in cash and marketable securities, no convertible debentures and no  debt. Working capital was $12.4m. POET says that, during the quarter, it achieved the following  milestones: POET has identified two key milestone objectives for the balance  of 2022: The 400G FR4 TX and RX optical engines are the building blocks  for an 800G FR4 optical engine that POET intends to introduce to the  market in time to capture a major inflection point identified in the April  LightCounting forecast report, in which deployments of 800G (2X400G) and 1.6T  transceiver modules are expected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate  (CAGR) of nearly 80% from about 2 million units in 2024 to 14 million  units by 2027. For packaged light sources, the ultimate market potential  is larger, with estimates of the total market size being about $125bn by 2027,  which the firm estimates will offer a serviceable market opportunity of over  $4bn by 2027. In support of the strategy to develop transceiver modules, the  firm has also modified the Optical Interposer platform so that it can more  readily accept lasers from leading global suppliers, and included the  capability to assemble the necessary electronic components directly onto the  interposer platform. POET has developed and will sample later this year a 400G  RX with an integrated trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) and a 200G FR4 TX with an  integrated laser driver. This integration of additional electronics  components has demonstrated a further increase in performance of the optical engines  and simplified module board design for customers. “Following the live demonstration of our 200G FR4 multiplexed TX  and RX optical engines and our ground-breaking live demonstration of our  400G/800G FR4 multiplexed RX engine at the Optical Fiber Conference in  March, we received multiple requests for technical data, samples and meetings  with interested customers and business partners,” says chairman & CEO  Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “We are executing well towards our dual strategy to  make available integrated optical engines for 100/200G to promote market  traction and acceptance, while simultaneously delivering more differentiated  solutions at 400/800G and beyond. There is a strong desire among module  companies to embrace our approach as we qualify our solutions and demonstrate  the required levels of reliability and manufacturability by releasing our  solutions to production. We have already begun the process of validating  performance, reliability and manufacturability with select customers who are  designing modules with our 100G and 200G optical engines,” he adds. “Even though the vast majority of 100/200/400G optical  transceivers sold today are built using discrete sub-assemblies, the  discussions during the recent PIC conference strongly indicate that the  industry is rapidly approaching a period in which hybrid integration will be  recognized as one of the few paths to meeting the scale, size and energy  performance requirements of the industry,” Venkatesan says. “As the number of  channels increase from 4 to 8 to 16 (in going from 400G to 1.6T), the balance  between conventional assembly and integrated assembly transitions quickly in  favor of chip-scale integration and wafer-level processing, both fundamental  tenants of the POET approach. It is widely acknowledged that a  small-form-factor 2x400G multiplexed FR4 integrated solution is needed at 800G  and absolutely required at 1.6T, and we believe that POET is in a pole position  to deliver it,” he adds. “Further, we believe the Optical Interposer platform is among  a few, if not the only, packaging technology that can provide the scale, size,  power and cost requirements needed for optoelectronic applications outside of  datacom and telecom, including optical computing, AR/VR, wearables, LiDAR and  other more consumer-oriented products, that will require vastly larger numbers  of devices to be produced annually at lower cost and higher performance.”
