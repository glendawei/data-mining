Navitas powers OnePlus’ first in-box GaN smartphone charger Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA  and Dublin, Ireland says that  its gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit  technology has been used by global mobile technology  company OnePlus for the 160W in-box fast charger  supplied with its latest OnePlus 10R  5G (worldwide) and OnePlus ACE  5G (China model) Android smartphones. The new OnePlus 10R/ACE 5G features a MediaTek Dimensity 8100-Max  chipset, a 6.7” AMOLED display supporting a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 50MP main camera. Its 4500mAhr battery offers 150W  SuperVOOC fast charging and the  ‘in-box’ 160W charger allows user to take their phone’s battery from 1-30% in  just three minutes, and 1-100% in  only 17 minutes. This is the first time that OnePlus has offered an in-box GaN  charger. Built around Navitas GaNFast ICs,  the unit measures just 58mm x 57mm x 30mm, giving it a power density of over 1.6W/cc. GaNFast ICs integrate GaN power with drive,  control, protection and sensing to enable 3x faster charging with up to 40%  energy saving in only half the size and weight, compared with legacy silicon  solutions. The 160W charger uses an NV6125 GaN power IC for the high-frequency boost power factor correction (PFC), followed by a  high-frequency quasi-resonant (QR) flyback converter. “Thanks to the close collaboration with Navitas we have created an  in-box charger that can take full advantage of the fast-charging capability of  the OnePlus 10R/ACE 5G Endurance  Edition,” says OnePlus’ chief operating officer Kinder (Fengshuo) Liu. “The key  to making the breakthrough in terms of size, weight and charging speed is the  GaNFast power IC technology. We  expect to continue our in-depth collaboration with Navitas,” he adds.
