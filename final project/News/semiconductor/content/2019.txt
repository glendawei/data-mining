In particular, the  third annual report spotlights Veeco’s progress towards its ESG goals released  earlier this year. “I think of 2021  as an inflection point for Veeco,” comments CEO Bill Miller. “We completed a  company-wide transformation and are now squarely focused on executing our  growth strategy and strengthening our commitment to ESG. Our vision is to  enable a future where technology improves the human experience, and we  recognize that achieving our vision is dependent, in part, on our corporate  sustainability efforts,” he adds. “Our first set of ESG Goals, released earlier  in 2022, was an important milestone on our sustainability journey.” The new report  features, among other updates, details pertaining to the firm’s ESG goals,  including baselines and the steps being taken to achieve them. A detailed  account of the ongoing implementation of a hazardous chemical management  program, disclosure aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  (SASB), and year-over-year improvements in the rate of renewable energy  procurement and emissions intensity are just a few of the developments that  point to Veeco’s alignment with stakeholders and commitment to corporate  responsibility.
