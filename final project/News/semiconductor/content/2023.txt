Mouser  announces  global distribution agreement with  Advanced Photonix Global semiconductor and  electronic component distributor Mouser Electronics Inc has announced a  new global distribution agreement with Advanced Photonix of Camarillo, CA, USA  (a division of OSI Optoelectronics), which provides photonics, optoelectronics  and electronic systems for aerospace & defence, medical and industrial  OEMs. With more than 30 years  of experience in optoelectronics and in-house semiconductor fabrication  services, Advanced Photonix designs, develops and fabricates photodetectors,  emitters and photoresistors. Mouser is hence now stocking the company’s  silicon, indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) P-I-N, APD photodiodes and  hybrids, and cadmium sulphide (CdS) light-dependent resistor (LDR)  photocells. The firm’s UV-enhanced  silicon photodiode offers a high-performance solution for applications requiring  highly sensitive devices in the ultraviolet region. The device features low  noise, high shunt resistance, and increased response with an active area  diameter of 2.54mm. Red-enhanced P-I-N and quadrant silicon photodiodes are  available in various features and packages for a wide range of applications.  The devices feature high accuracy with a large active area and low  crosstalk, suitable for accurate nulling, centering or measuring small  positional changes. The blue-enhanced P-I-N photodiodes offer high responsivity,  large active area and low noise, and are suitable for high-speed response  applications in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Advanced Photonix CdS  photocells have sensitivity in the 400-700nm visible light region. The LDRs,  available in a wide range of resistances, decrease resistance as the light  level increases with efficiency characteristics like those of the human eye.
