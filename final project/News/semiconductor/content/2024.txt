Agnitron installs Agilis 100 gallium oxide MOCVD system at Cornell Agnitron  Technology Inc of Chanhassen, MN, USA says that a Agilis 100 metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system installed in the Duffield Hall laboratory of Dr Hari Nair, assistant research professor of materials science & engineering, at Cornell  University began operation on  30 June. The firm says that the  Agilis 100 delivers what are claimed to be multiple,  best-in-class capabilities that support R&D of oxide semiconductors. The  system can reach substrate temperatures exceeding 1500°C (2700°F) and keep it  within +/-1.0°C, and it has the ability to grow epitaxial semiconductor layers  at unmatched purities and rates.
