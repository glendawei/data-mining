Aixtron’s Q2 revenue up 51% year-on-year, driven by demand from SiC and GaN power electronics Deposition equipment maker Aixtron SE of Herzogenrath,  near Aachen, Germany has reported 63% growth in revenue (equipment  & after-sales), from €117.2m in first-half 2021 to €191.1m in first-half 2022. Of total  revenue, 78% came from equipment sales (€148.6m, up 62% on €91.6m in first-half  2021), while 22% came from after-sales service & spare parts (€42.4m, up  65% on €25.7m in first-half 2021).  Second-quarter 2022 revenue was €102.5m, up 16% on $88.6m in Q1/2022 and  up 51% on €67.7m in Q2/2021. Of the  equipment revenue, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)/chemical  vapor deposition (CVD) equipment for making gallium nitride (GaN)- and silicon  carbide (SiC)-based power electronics devices comprised 29% (with SiC growing  strongly); MOCVD equipment for making optoelectronics devices  (telecoms/datacoms and 3D sensing lasers for consumer electronics, solar, and  wireless/RF communications) comprised 24% (with optical data transmission and  5G applications growing strongly); and MOCVD equipment for making LEDs  comprised 43% (mainly traditional red LEDs, but also micro-LED applications). On a regional  basis for first-half 2022 revenue, 70% came from Asia (up from 62% in  first-half 2021), 16% from Europe (down from 32%) and 14% from the Americas (up  from just 6%). First-half 2022 gross margin was level year-on-year at 39%. However, Q2/2022 gross margin of 37% is down from Q2/2021’s 41%, driven by a comparatively  low-margin product mix (from the delivery of equipment  for producing traditional red LEDs) as well as one-off costs incurred  from projects to optimize production and supply chain processes. Operating expenses rose from €40.2m in  first-half 2021 to €42.3m in first-half 2022, due to increased R&D expenses  and higher variable-compensation components. However, quarterly operating expenses have been cut from  €21.7m in Q1/2022 to €20.6m in Q2/2022, due to €1.1m lower  R&D expenses. The operating result (EBIT, earnings  before interest and taxes) increased year-on-year from €4.9m (EBIT margin of 4%) in first-half 2021 to €31.4m (16% margin) in first-half 2022. Quarterly EBIT  has more than tripled year-on-year from €5.6m (8% margin) in Q2/2021 and €14.2m  (16% margin) in Q1/2022 to €17.2m (17% margin) in Q2/2022. Net profit rose from €11.5m in first-half 2021 (10%  of revenue) to €31.1m (16% of revenue) in first-half 2022. Quarterly net profit has more than doubled, from €7.7m (11% of revenue) in Q2/2021  then €13.8m (16% of revenue) in Q1/2022) to €17.3m (17% of revenue) in Q2/2022. Despite quarterly  operating cash flow of -€27.6m in Q2/2022, first-half 2022 operating cash flow  was €35.4m. Capital  expenditure (CapEx) was €8.9m in first-half 2022, including €4.2m in Q2/2022. Free cash flow was hence €26.4m in first-half 2022 (almost halving from €46.1m  in in first-half 2021) – including just €4m in Q2/2022 – as the increase in  advance payments received for customer orders was outweighed by the corresponding  increase in inventories (from €120.6m to €161.6m during first-half 2022) in preparation for  the higher business volume in the coming quarters. At the annual  general meeting (AGM) of shareholders on 25 May Aixtron proposed a dividend  payment of €0.30 per share (up from €0.11 per share in 2021), totalling €33.7m (a  payout ratio of 35% of the firm’s net income). Cash and cash equivalents including financial assets hence fell from €352.5m  at end-December 2021 to €346.2m at end-June. Aixtron says that its financial strength is  underlined by its high equity ratio  of 78% at the end of June (up from 73% at end-June 2021). Meanwhile, staffing has risen by 8% from 718 to  772. So, structural strengthening of the organization for further growth is reckoned  to be well on track. “We were able to grow  as planned despite the challenging market environment with supply chains remaining constrained,” says chief financial officer Dr Christian Danninger. “In addition, we are driving process  improvements along the entire organization in order to prepare Aixtron SE for the expected future growth.” Order intake (including equipment and  after-sales) has grown by 7% year-on-year from €263.3m in first-half 2021 to €282.8m in  first-half 2022. In particular,  Q2/2022 order intake was €152.6m, up 17.2% on even  last quarter’s strong €130.2m and up 10% on €139m a year ago (and Aixtron’s highest  quarterly order intake since Q2/2011).  “Many years of research work are now paying off,” says CEO Dr Felix Grawert. “This quarter marks  another milestone as we are not only showing continued strong growth on a broad  basis in our addressed markets [particularly SiC- and GaN-based power electronics], but especially with the first order for our equipment for  the volume production of micro-LEDs.” Equipment order backlog at the end of June was  €314.4m, up 20.7% on €260.4m at the end of March. Most of the order backlog is due for delivery in 2022. Based on a  budget rate of $1.20/€ (versus $1.25/€ in 2021), due to the good business  development in first-half 2022 and in view of the expectation of a positive  development of demand for the remainder of 2022, Aixtron expects double-digit  growth in full-year order intake  to €520-580m for 2022. Based on the first-half 2022 revenue of €191.1m plus a  forecasted €40m in after-sales revenue, joined by equipment order backlog of  €150m (as of end-June) plus a forecasted €70-120m in new order intake (convertible  into revenue during 2022), Aixtron still expects double-digit growth in  full-year revenue to €450-500m in 2022.  Full-year  gross margin should be about 41% and EBIT margin should be 21-23% for 2022  (again reiterating the guidance given  in February). “Overall, the current global crisis situations and market developments  continue to only have a minor impact on our business,” notes Aixtron. “Logistics  and supply chains are still challenging, but in our view continue  to be manageable.”
