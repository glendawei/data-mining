Lumentum’s acquisition of NeoPhotonics receives anti-trust clearance in China Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose,  CA, USA says that it has  obtained anti-trust clearance from the People’s Republic of China’s State Administration for Market Regulation in  connection with its pending acquisition of San Jose-based  NeoPhotonics Corp. NeoPhotonics is a vertically integrated designer  and manufacturer of silicon photonics and hybrid photonic integrated circuit  (PIC)-based lasers, modules and subsystems for high-speed communications. Lumentum  designs and makes photonics products for optical networks and lasers for  industrial and consumer markets. The clearance satisfies the acquisition’s closing condition set  forth in the merger agreement (announced on 3 November)  regarding the receipt of anti-trust approval in the People’s Republic of China. Previously (on 21 January) Lumentum announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart–Scott–Rodino  Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) in the USA, which was another condition  for closing the transaction. Lumentum hence now expects that the NeoPhotonics acquisition will  close on or around 3 August. Under the terms of merger agreement, each share of NeoPhotonics  common stock will be converted into the right to receive $16 in cash upon the  completion of the transaction.
