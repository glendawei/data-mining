Navitas sponsoring China International New Energy Vehicle Forum Gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit  firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland is sponsoring the 12th China  International New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Forum, which is due to take  place in in Suzhou (4-5 August). NEV 2022 combines an exhibition with  technical presentations showcasing the latest automotive power and  infrastructure developments, and will be attended by over 1000 industry  representatives. Since GaN is reckoned to run up to 20x faster than silicon,  GaNFast power ICs are said to  deliver up to 3x faster charging or 3x more power with up to 40% energy savings in half the size and weight for  mobile, consumer, enterprise, eMobility and new energy  markets. Founded in 2014, Navitas introduced what it claimed to be the first  commercial GaN power ICs. Its proprietary GaNFast power ICs with GaNSense  technology integrate power, drive and control with additional  autonomous-protection and loss-less current sensing  in a single SMT package. With more than 150 Navitas patents issued or pending,  over 50 million units have been shipped with zero reported field failures. Navitas  has also introduced the industry’s only 20-year warranty. On 5 August (4pm) at NEV 2022, Hao Sun, senior director  of Navitas’ EV Design Center, is presenting ‘A GaNFast Future in EV  Applications’. The EV Design Center hosts a team of power system  designers with capabilities spanning electrical, thermal and mechanical design,  software development, and complete simulation and prototyping capabilities. EV  customers are supported from concept to prototype, through to full  qualification and mass production.
