GaN Systems’ transistors powering HARMAN’s 100W 4-port USB InstantCharger GaN Systems Inc of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of  gallium nitride-based power switching semiconductors for power  conversion and control applications) says that its GS-065-011-1-L power transistor is being used in Samsung Electronics subsidiary  HARMAN’s new InfinityLab InstantCharger 100W, 4 USB GaN charger. Made from 90%  recycled plastics, the charger features two USB-A ports plus two USB-C ports,  safely charging up to four devices simultaneously (phones, tablets, laptops,  speakers, headphones, gaming consoles, drones, cameras, power banks  etc). Power Delivery 3.0 ensures fast charging, and the charger is  smart enough to know how to allocate power, depending on which devices are  plugged in. “HARMAN’s  GaN-powered charger addresses the needs of today’s consumer while putting  sustainability front and center,” comments GaN Systems’ CEO Jim Witham.  “The ability for GaN-based chargers to power multiple devices means that  consumers need fewer chargers and can keep them longer,” he adds. “This has  significant sustainability implications when considering the more than  30,000 tons of landfills generated by discarded cell phone and laptop  chargers each year.”
