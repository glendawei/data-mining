Riber’s first-half revenue stable at €9.3m despite electronic component shortage For first-half  2022, Riber S.A.  of Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources and effusion cells – has reported revenue of €9.2m, slightly  below the €9.3m  a year previously due to the difficulties in sourcing electronic  components preventing further deliveries. MBE  system revenue was €2.9m, up 5% from about €2.8m in first-half 2021. Revenues  for Services & Accessories was €6.3m, down 3% from €6.5m. Of total revenue,  39% came from Europe (up from 29%), 56% from Asia (down from 63%), and 5% from  North America (down from 7%). In a  context of MBE market growth, new orders received during first-half 2022 grew  strongly, comprising eight MBE systems (including four production systems) and a  stronger level of orders for Services & Accessories. The  order book at the end of June was hence up strongly, by 76%, from €17.4m in 2021  to €30.6m in 2022. Specifically, the Services  & Accessories order book rose by 10% from €6.9m to €7.6m, confirming the  positive trend in MBE research and production activities. The Systems order book more  than doubled (up by 119%) from €10.5m to €23m. This included four  production systems (versus just one in 2021) and seven research systems (versus  four in 2021). Also, this does not include: (1) orders announced on 25 July for two  research systems; and (2) the option to buy (announced on 8 June) covering  four production machines for which firm orders will be confirmed when the  export license is obtained. Riber says that it continues  to face a shortage of deliveries of electronic boxes (resulting from the  current microprocessor shortage), which are crucial components for its MBE  machines to operate. System revenue for second-half 2022 is therefore  uncertain, as the planned system deliveries are dependent on the resumption of  deliveries of electronic boxes. “The  reduced visibility in the short term does not detract from the robust  positioning of the company’s activities or their potential for growth over the  medium and long term,” the firm notes. First-half earnings and the outlook for full-year  2022 will be issued on 28 September.
