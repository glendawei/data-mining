Infineon’s CoolSiC devices support Delta’s bi-directional inverter CoolSiC products from Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany have been adopted by Delta  Electronics (a Taiwan-based global provider of power and energy management  solutions) to allow a step towards energy transition and carbon neutrality with green power. With the  development of bi-directional inverters, a hybrid three-in-one system that  integrates solar, energy storage and  charging of electric vehicles (EV),  Delta is enabling EVs to become a household emergency backup power.
