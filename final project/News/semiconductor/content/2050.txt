Lowe’s offering AquiSense’s UV-C LED water disinfection systems To sell its consumer  product lines PearlAqua Deca and PearlAqua AutoMate online in the USA,  AquiSense Technologies LLC of Erlanger, KY, USA (which designs and  manufactures water disinfection systems based on UV-C LEDs) has partnered  with Lowe’s Companies Inc of Mooresville, NC (one of the largest home improvement suppliers in the USA and  Canada, with an average of 19 million  transactions per week). The PearlAqua Deca is the first UV-C LED system in the  whole-house water treatment category for Lowe’s. The PearlAqua Deca is claimed  to be the world’s first UV-C LED system for whole-house point-of-entry  applications. The Deca offers low cost of ownership and low maintenance, together with third-party tested and reliable UV disinfection capabilities. The PearlAqua AutoMate  provides consumers with the benefits of point-of-use UV while also automating  the disinfection process simply with the flow of water. The AutoMate is  suitable for under-the-sink water treatment  with a UV-C LED reactor that is NSF certified  to Standard 55-2019. “Over the last few years  Lowe’s has put an emphasis on recognizing the changing nature of home,”  comments AquiSense’s sales director Aaron Leber. “Lowe’s awareness and  adaptability to quickly fine tune their product offerings made them a  perfect partner to showcase our emerging technology.”
