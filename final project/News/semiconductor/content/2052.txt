CNRS-CRHEA and FOTON Institute order two Riber Compact 21 research MBE systems Riber S.A.  of Bezons, France — which designs and makes  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources  and effusion cells — has  received orders for two Compact 21  research MBE systems (to be delivered in 2023). France’s  CNRS-CRHEA (Centre de Recherche sur L’Hétéro-Epitaxie et ses Applications – Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) — which  specializes in epitaxial growth of wide-bandgap semiconductor materials —  has ordered a Compact 21  system to strengthen its research capacity for emerging semiconductor  materials. Riber has also sold another Compact 21 system to France’s FOTON Institute (Fonctions Optiques pour les Technologies de  l’informatiON - CNRS UMR) — a center of academic excellence in photonics  for information technology — which  will help to expand its research capabilities. The acquisition of the two Riber’s systems was carried out  through the NANOFUTUR Project. Financed by the French government via the  National Research Agency, the project aims to structure the French nanotechnology  community for the next ten years  by providing it with the state-of-the-art equipment that will allow it to  evolve at the highest level globally.
