III-V Epi meets demand for reduced-lead-time wafer design, manufacture, test and characterization III-V Epi Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK — which provides a fast-turnaround service for  custom compound semiconductor wafer  design, manufacturing, test and characterization — says that, by focusing on  low- to medium-volume manufacturing, it has been able to provide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), III-V, epitaxial structures, and  overgrowth services with shorter lead times  than the industry standard. “III-V Epi has helped many customers bring new, compound semiconductor products to market quickly,  with its reduced-lead-time manufacture,” says director Calum McGregor. “This  has been achieved by using two key strategies. Firstly, by specializing in  medium- to low-volume supply, we have been able to separate ourselves from the  volume part of the industry, dominated by consumer product  giants swallowing up the world’s production capacity. Secondly, we have removed  potential NPI [new product introduction]  bottlenecks for customers by offering expertise in every part of the process,  from wafer design, product development and process optimization  through to a complete range of test, metrology and characterization services.” III-V Epi reckons that its unique approach makes it a suitable  supply partner for companies requiring low-volume supply, such as universities,  start-ups and smaller-scale industrial businesses. The firm already supplies  devices for communications, telecoms, quantum technology,  defence, security, automotive, agriculture and additive manufacturing markets.
