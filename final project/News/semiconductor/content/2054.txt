Impedans raises €3.5m in Series B funding round Impedans of Dublin, Ireland, which  specializes in intelligent sensors for RF and plasma processing, has raised €3.5m  from a combination of new and existing investors, including venture capital and  investment management firm SOSV (which is headquartered in  Princeton, NJ, USA, but has operations in Cork, Ireland) and Irish Government agency  Enterprise Ireland.  Founded by Mike Hopkins in 2004, Impedans has plans to grow headcount by 40% in  2022. “This is a significant milestone  for our company as we grow to meet the demands of the global semiconductor  market, forecasted to reach $1 trillion by 2030,” says CEO Dr David Gahan. Despite prevailing economic conditions, the  semiconductor market is still on track to achieve low-double-digit percentage  growth in 2022. “Our patented technology enables  companies to both reduce scrappage and increase process repeatability, critical  factors for this burgeoning industry. The funding is key for driving a strategy  of continuous innovation and will help to consolidate our position as leaders  in the field,” he adds. “SOSV is proud to back such a  global and strategically significant technology in the chip making space,”  says SOSV general partner Bill  Liao. “This round backs a real Irish deep-tech win,” he adds. 
  “Enterprise Ireland is proud to continue  its support for this Irish-owned global leader,” says Gillian Baker, Enterprise Ireland’s senior development adviser Digital Technologies. “Their key markets offer tremendous  potential for growth, and we are confident that they are positioned to  capitalize on this.”
