TSLC-SemiLEDs to supply components for Cepton’s LiDAR solutions Optoelectronic  system manufacturer TSLC Corp, a  subsidiary of LED chip and component maker  SemiLEDs Corp of Hsinchu Science Park,  Taiwan, has been selected to supply key components for both automotive  and non-automotive light detection and ranging (LiDAR) solutions made by  Silicon Valley-based Cepton Inc, which has developed high performance  micro-motion technology (MMT) LiDAR. TSLC is a  technology developer and manufacturer of ultra-precision optoelectronic  systems, with more than 10 years of  experience innovating unique semiconductor package solutions such as  wafer-level packaging. The firm has worked with Cepton for the past two years to qualify and validate TSLC’s  manufacturing processes in preparation for large-scale deployment of Cepton’s  LiDAR solutions. Specifically, TSLC is now qualified to manufacture components  supporting what is reckoned to be the largest advanced driver-assistance system  (ADAS) LiDAR series production award in the industry. “Using TSLC’s  advanced micro-packaging technology together with our ultra-precision alignment  technology, we have delivered thousands of components used in Cepton’s LiDAR solutions,”  says TSLC’s CEO Trung Doan, chairman/CEO of SemiLEDs. “We are excited to be  selected as a supplier of key components for Cepton’s LiDAR for large-scale  deployment,” he adds. “Cepton’s LiDAR solutions are making our roadways safer  by reducing accidents and enabling higher levels of autonomy.”
