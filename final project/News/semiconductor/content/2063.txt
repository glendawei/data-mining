UIUC demos cubic GaN on large-area U-grooved silicon (100) dies Gallium nitride  (GaN) and its alloys (i.e. III-nitride semiconductors) are the backbones of  solid-state lighting, and next-generation RF and power electronics. Most  R&D in this material system is currently focused on its conventional,  hexagonal (i.e. wurtzite) phase. However, its  cubic (i.e. zincblende) phase has more inherent advantages. These include: no  polarization in the <100> growth direction, smaller bandgap,  smaller electron-heavy hole effective masses, less Auger loss,  larger optical gain,  shorter radiative recombination  lifetime, lower p-doping activation energy, higher hole mobility,  and larger conduction-band offset. Cubic III-nitride  semiconductors might thus enable next-generation devices such as  efficiency-droop-free III-nitride visible light-emitting diodes  (LEDs) and as-grown, normally-off aluminium gallium nitride/gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN) power transistors. However, the  synthesis of cubic GaN has not been an easy task due to its metastability. In ‘Structural  and Optical Properties of Cubic GaN on U-grooved Si(100)’ (J.Lee, Y. C.Chiu,  M.A.Johar and C.Bayram, Appl. Phys. Lett. 121, 032101 (2022)), a team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)  team has reported a III-nitride materials breakthrough: the synthesis – by metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) – of low-defect-density, stable and pure-phase cubic GaN on  the scalable silicon platform.
