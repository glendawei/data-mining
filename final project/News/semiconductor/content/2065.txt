Anker partners with Infineon, Navitas, Innoscience and Southchip to develop all-GaN fast chargers Mobile charging and consumer electronics products firm Anker  Innovations of Changsha, Hunan, China has  partnered with gallium nitride (GaN) technology firms to develop a new  generation of charging solutions for both home and on-the-go. “GaN is allowing us to completely change the way we charge our  electronics by delivering better power transfer efficiency, faster-charging  speeds, and smaller, more portable chargers,” says CEO Steven  Yang. “Our partners provided exclusive access to cutting-edge GaN  technology that empowered us to create chargers that last longer and are more  sustainable.” To develop its  new, higher-watt GaN chargers (with power output of over 100W), Anker partnered  with semiconductor manufacturer Infineon  Technologies AG of Munich, Germany  as well as GaN power integrated circuit firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland. By  applying their technology, Anker was able to increase the efficiency of its new  GaN chargers, reducing both the electricity lost by the charger while in use as  well as the chargers’ carbon footprint. “By combining Infineon’s Hybrid Flyback and CoolGaN switch in  Anker’s new charging lineup, we achieved a system efficiency of 95%, amongst  the highest level in industry, reducing energy losses by about 20% in  comparison with other charging solutions,” reckons Adam  White, Infineon division president of Power & Sensor Systems.  “This is the first time Infineon’s HFB architecture and the CoolGaN switch have  been applied together to any commercially available consumer electronics,” he  adds.
