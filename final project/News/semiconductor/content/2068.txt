IQE sues Tower over porous silicon technology Epiwafer and substrate maker IQE plc of Cardiff, Wales, UK  has filed a  lawsuit against specialty analog foundry Tower Semiconductor Ltd of Migdal Haemek, Israel. IQE claims that it has significant  evidence that Tower misappropriated IQE’s trade secrets to unlawfully  obtain patents on IQE’s technology. These claims relate to IQE’s proprietary  porous silicon technology which would underpin devices used in 5G and  advanced sensing applications. IQE filed its complaint in the US Federal Court  in California (case number 8:22-cv-00867) under Federal and California state  law in relation to the misappropriation of trade secrets, correction of  inventorship, breach of contract, unfair competition, and intentional  interference with prospective economic advantage. “We have  significant reason to believe that Tower has misappropriated IQE’s proprietary  trade secrets for its own benefit,” says IQE’s general counsel  & company secretary Tom Dale. “Our  technology, processes and intellectual property are  vital in underpinning IQE’s products and solutions and in maintaining our  market-leading position in advanced semiconductor materials,” he adds. “We will  vigorously protect them and will provide further updates as material  developments occur.”
