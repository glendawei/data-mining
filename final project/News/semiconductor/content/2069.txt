CVD Equipment’s orders grow 73% in first-half 2022 CVD  Equipment Corp of Central Islip, NY, USA (a designer and maker of  chemical vapor deposition, gas control and other equipment and process solutions for developing and manufacturing materials and  coatings) says that in second-quarter 2022 orders exceeded $12.6m, more  than doubling from $6m a year ago. Orders in first-half  2022 totalled $16.7m (up 73.2% year-on-year from $9.7m for first-half 2021),  attributed to strong demand for the PVT-150 system developed to support the  manufacturing of silicon carbide  (SiC) wafers used in high-power electronics for electric vehicle (EV) charging and power transmission. Also  contributing is the need for nanotechnology materials, including carbon nanotubes/fibers, nanomaterials on powder  and superconducting tape. All these orders support the EV market as well as the  trend for the electrification of everything, says the firm. In first-half 2022,  total orders amounted to 20 CVD systems (for shipment in second-half 2022 and  into 2023). “Our focus in 2022 is on applications that support electric vehicles and more broadly the  electrification of everything, while sustaining our presence and support of our  aerospace applications,” says president & CEO Emmanuel Lakios. “We are  encouraged and pleased with the response of the market place to our products,  technologies and services.”
