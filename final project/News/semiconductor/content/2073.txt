Transphorm adds 50mΩ 650V SuperGaN FET in TO-263, extending SMDs to high-power applications Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures  JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride  (GaN) field-effect transistors  (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion  — has expanded its surface-mount package offerings with the addition of  the TP65H050G4BS. The new higher-power surface-mount device (SMD) is a 650V  SuperGaN FET in a TO-263 (D2PAK) offering a typical on-resistance of 50mΩ. It marks Transphorm’s seventh SMD, adding to  a wide range of currently available PQFN devices for lower- to mid-power  applications.
