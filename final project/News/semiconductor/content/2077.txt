IQE expects revenue growth of 7% for first-half 2022 In an unaudited pre-close update for  first-half 2022, epiwafer and substrate maker  IQE plc of Cardiff, Wales, UK says that trading was  in line with management expectations. Revenue is expected to be at least £85m  (>7% growth) on a reported basis. With a foreign exchange tailwind, this is in line with £79.5m a year ago on  a constant-currency basis. “I  am pleased we have met our expectations and commitments for first-half 2022,”  says CEO Americo Lemos. IQE  will report full (unaudited) interim results on 6 September. The firm’s view of the full year remains  unchanged with previously issued guidance of low-single-digit % revenue growth  in 2022 (at constant currency), with growth weighted towards second-half  2022. IQE says it is focussing on executing the  strategy of pursuing long-term sustained growth through diversification and  value creation. Milestones achieved in first-half 2022 include the signing of a  multi-year supply agreement with Lumentum, a strategic partnership agreement  with Porotech, the announcement of the world’s first commercially available  200mm VCSEL, and a commitment to Net Zero  and Carbon Neutrality. Further  milestones are anticipated for second-half 2022 as the business is positioned  for growth. “This year is  about laying foundations for the healthy growth of the business, with a focus  on a market approach while developing relationships with strategic customers to  deliver long-term growth and value to shareholders,” says Lemos. “We look  forward to continuing with this momentum throughout the rest of the year.”
