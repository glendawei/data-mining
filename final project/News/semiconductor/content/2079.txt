Mission Microwave wins $8m follow-on order for SATCOM terminal upgrade program Mission  Microwave Technologies LLC of Cypress, CA, USA, which manufactures  gallium nitride (GaN)-based solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) and  block up-converters (BUCs), has confirmed an $8m order for the continuation of a major  upgrade program for a customer supporting a US Government requirement. Mission Microwave  engineers worked with their customer to create an upgrade path for the US  Government to replace legacy traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTA)-based block upconverters (BUCs) with solid-state  BUCs, based on GaN technology, to upgrade a fleet of widely deployed  transportable terminals. The initial upgrades started in late 2019 and, prior  to this recent award, over 100 sets of Ku- and Ka-band BUCs have been delivered  to Mission Microwave’s customer on the program. Mission Microwave  is providing 200W Ka-band and 400W Ku-band BUCs to replace legacy TWTA-based  upconverters. The firm says that its competency in designing compact and highly  efficient amplifiers has enabled its customer to offer an upgrade path that  will extend the life and improve the utility of this tactical SATCOM terminal  fleet. “The end-users of  our products rely on SATCOM system providers to bring the benefits of  solid-state designs to the tactical edge,” says Steve Richeson, VP of sales  & marketing. “We worked with our customers’ engineering team to navigate  the complexities of the upgrade and certification process for these terminals,”  he adds. “We expect the established trend of replacing high-power TWTAs with  SSPAs to be a significant market for the foreseeable future, led by our recent  additions of 400W Ka-band and 800W X-band BUCs to our product line.”
