AGIC Capital invests in UV lithography firm Eulitha European-Asian private equity firm  AGIC Capital says that an investment fund under its management has  invested in Eulitha AG of Kirchdorf,  Switzerland (a spin-off of the Paul Scherrer Institute founded  in 2006). Eulitha offers non-contact,  high-resolution nano-UV photolithography systems and customized patterning  services for applications including DFB/DBR (distributed feedback/distributed  Bragg reflector) lasers, AR/VR (augmented reality and virtual reality),  telecommunications, optical components and bio-sensors/chips. The firm  says that its proprietary PHABLE technology is considered to be a preferable  option to traditional nanoimprint technology due to lower costs, higher  throughput, better consistency, longer mask lifetime and compatibility  with non-flat substrates. Eulitha says that AGIC Capital was  attracted to its positioning as a unique technology provider in fast-growing  markets including AR/VR industries and its promising commercialization pipeline  backed by strong R&D abilities. AGIC Capital will work closely with the  management team to support Eulitha’s international development (particularly  the Asia Pacific region) and use resources with large industrial players  to help the company increase sales and customers. “Eulitha is well poised to gain  substantially from the underlying market trends favoring its proprietary  equipment and process technology solutions,” believes Heiko von Dewitz,  partner of AGIC Capital in Europe. “We will work with the Eulitha  management team to scale up the business and accelerate its growth across a  variety of industries,” he adds. “We are delighted to have AGIC  Capital on board on our journey to become a global leader in offering  lithography solutions to the growing photonics industries,” says Eulitha’s CEO  & co-founder Dr Harun Solak. “With this investment Eulitha will be  significantly expanding its resources, both financially and in terms of its  market reach, to further develop and market its unique photolithography  equipment and associated technologies.”
