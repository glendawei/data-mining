ACM introduces post-CMP cleaning tool for silicon and SiC substrate manufacturing ACM Research Inc (ACM) of Fremont, CA, USA, which  develops and manufactures wafer processing equipment for semiconductor device  and advanced wafer-level packaging (WLP) applications, has launched its new  post-CMP cleaning tool. This is ACM’s first tool of its kind, serving as  a cleaning step following the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)  process used to manufacture high-quality substrates. It is available in 6- and  8-inch configurations for silicon carbide (SiC), and 8- and 12-inch  configurations for silicon wafer manufacturing. The tool is available in wet-in dry-out  (WIDO) and dry-in dry out (DIDO) configurations, with 2-, 4- and 6-chamber  options to achieve maximum throughput of up to 60 wafers per hour  (WPH).

ACM’s post-CMP cleaning tool is available in multiple  configurations, including advanced cleaning technologies with ACM’s Smart  Megasonix.
