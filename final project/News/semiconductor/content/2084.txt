Navitas acquires VDD Tech to expand high-power, next-gen semiconductor capabilities Gallium nitride (GaN) power  integrated circuit firm Navitas  Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA  and Dublin, Ireland has acquired VDD Tech of Mont-Saint-Guibert,  Belgium, a creator of digital-isolators for next-generation power conversion. Advanced digital-isolation techniques are essential to deliver  size, weight and system-cost improvements in high-power markets such as  consumer, motor drive, solar, data center and electric vehicles (EVs).  VDD Tech’s proprietary modulation-technique is said to enable stable, reliable,  efficient power conversion at MHz+ switching speeds. Proprietary dV/dt sensing, blanking and refresh technologies  enable a combination of very-high-voltage isolation capability with the highest  frequency of operation requiring 5-10x higher dV/dt immunity than legacy  silicon. Low isolation-capacitance (<0.5pF) and innovative, robust  modulation deliver low-jitter digital-communication for isolated-driver control  and analog-sensing feedback. A minimum 200V/ns common-mode transient immunity (CMTI)  is uniquely guaranteed across all temperature and operating conditions. VDD Tech was founded by Vincent Dessard, quickly joined by Aimad  Saib, each of them holding a doctorate and 15+ years’ experience in  analog/mixed-mode IC research and development. Dessard and Saib have taken  leading roles in Navitas’ advanced R&D teams. “It’s exciting to see two breakthrough technologies – optimized  digital-isolators and GaN power ICs – combine to deliver such  leading-edge, high-power solutions,” says Dessard. “High-speed and  high-reliability are the critical factors to accelerate wide-bandgap  semiconductor adoption over legacy silicon chips, and we’re very excited to be  a catalyst in this once-in-a-generation revolution, with new, high-power  products launching in 2023,” he adds.
