VIGO’s Q2 revenue grows 12.7% year-on-year For second-quarter  2022, VIGO Photonics S.A.  of Ożarów Mazowiecki, Poland (which manufactures mid-infrared photonic  detectors, detection modules and semiconductor materials) has reported revenue growth  of 12.7% year-on-year to PLN20.3m. Sales of  semiconductor materials rose by 21.2% to PLN1.31m (6.5% of total revenue). Sales of detection modules rose 12.2% to PLN19m  (93.5% of total revenue), with transport, industry and science & medicine the  best-growing applications. The largest growth  in detection modules was recorded among industrial applications (up 37.7% from just over PLN7m a year ago to PLN10m, 49.3% of total revenue) and transport applications (up 57.3% from under PLN2m to PLN3m, 14.9% of total  revenue). The science & medicine  division is also on the rise (up 36.2%, to just 5.9% of total revenue,  but particularly important for the  firm’s growth). In the military segment (23.3% of revenue), the firm is still fulfilling orders, but  their number has now decreased compared to last year. VIGO’s second-best-ever  revenue quarter is attributed to the consistently implemented growth strategy  adopted in 2021. The record of PLN22.3m in Q4/2021 was influenced mainly by the  execution of orders in the detector segment for two customers in the security  systems and defence industries. First-half 2022 revenue  totalled PLN32m. “We are growing, despite many market challenges,” notes Adam Piotrowski,  president of the management board. Q2/2022 orders  were up 36% year-on-year. A  particularly significant increase in orders was recorded from the Asian market —  up nearly three-fold year-on-year for first-half 2022. The US market grew by  28% and the European market by 18%. “It confirms  the constantly growing interest in VIGO products and the development of  new applications for infrared detectors,” notes Łukasz Piekarski, member of the  management board. “It facilitates production planning, which is particularly important  with the current problems of access to certain electronic components. Thanks to  larger orders from existing and new customers, we are able to secure better  prices and shorter delivery times,” he adds. After beginning operation in 1987 and being listed on the  main market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange  since 2014, in 2021 VIGO presented a new two-stage  development strategy for 2021–2026, in which six development initiatives  — technological  areas, aimed at strengthening the company’s position as one of the most  innovative and dynamically developing companies on the market — were singled out (including, in December, beginning  a rebranding involving changing the firm’s name from VIGO System to VIGO Photonics). By 2023, the firm’s objective will be to continue the  R&D projects initiated in photonic technologies, integrated circuits, detectors made of III-V  materials, epitaxy of semiconductor materials, and infrared source  technologies. The technological and technical base will be developed. The firm reckons that its development strategy will allow it to  maintain a 20-30% annual revenue growth rate, to about PLN80m in 2022 and  PLN100m in 2023. Earnings before interest,  taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is expected to rise to  about PLN40m in 2023 (totalling PLN103m of normalized EBITDA for 2021–2023).  The second stage of the strategy will be executed until 2026 (inclusive) and  will consist of the implementation of selected development initiatives.
