Navitas highlighting fast charging at Asia Charging Expo Gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit  firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo,  CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland is participating (as a sponsor) in the 2022  Asia Charging Expo and Global Third Generation Semiconductor Industry Summit at  the Futian Convention & Exhibition Center in Shenzhen, China  (18-20 July). Since GaN is reckoned to run up to 20x faster than silicon,  GaNFast power ICs are said to deliver up to 3x faster charging or 3x more power  with up to 40% energy savings in half the size and weight for mobile, consumer,  enterprise, eMobility and new energy markets. GaNFast power ICs with  GaNSense technology integrates power, drive, control, with additional  autonomous-protection and loss-less current-sensing to deliver what is claimed  to be the simplest, smallest, fastest and now even higher-power performance.  New ‘ultra-fast’ charging enables smartphone charging from 0-100% in less than  10 minutes using a small, light, ultra-portable 150W GaN charger.
