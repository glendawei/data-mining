LayTec adds fully automated wafer handling and cassette-to-cassette loading to EpiX mapping station After introducing  its EpiX mapping station some years ago, in-situ  metrology system maker LayTec AG of Berlin, Germany is now bringing  its newest EpiX generation to the market. The first demonstration unit of the  new system is being displayed in the firm’s booth at the 20th International  Conference on Metal Organic  Vapor Phase Epitaxy (ICMOVPE XX) in Stuttgart, Germany (10-14 July). As with previous  EpiX generations, the new system is equipped with white light reflectance and multi-wavelength photoluminescence  spectroscopy for wafer inspection. Now the system  has been equipped with fully automated wafer handling and cassette-to-cassette  (C2C) wafer loading to also serve the requirements of high-throughput  industrial applications. Also, Dr Johannes Zettler is giving a detailed  presentation about the new product at LayTec‘s in-situ seminar at ICMOVPE XX.
