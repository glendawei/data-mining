Thin-film metrology system maker k-Space celebrates 30th anniversary k-Space Associates Inc of Dexter, MI, USA  – which was founded in 1992 and produces  thin-film metrology instrumentation and software for research and manufacturing  of microelectronic, optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices – is  celebrating 30 years of helping the world’s leading technology makers  develop, monitor, control and manufacture their products in the thin-film,  semiconductor, solar and glass markets, to name a few. “After 30 years it’s still so satisfying to walk into a laboratory  or a manufacturing facility and see our metrology tools being used in real-time  for process monitoring and control,” comments CEO Darryl Barlett. k-Space’s thin-film metrology applications employ patented methods  to accurately measure and monitor wafer temperature, stress, curvature, bow,  deposition rate, thickness, reflectivity, spectral reflectance and  transmission, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). On the industrial metrology side, k-Space’s tools are used in  production facilities worldwide to measure precise part features, surface  defects and more to ensure high yield and quality compliance. Such measurements are vital for the  manufacturing of semiconductor chips, solar panels, architectural glass,  building materials, and other products. k-Space has distributors in Europe, India, China, Japan, South Korea,  and throughout the world. The firm says that, through extensive customer input,  close collaboration with its worldwide customer base, and a strong  commitment to technical support, it continues to develop new  solutions that help its customers fulfill even their most complex metrology needs.
