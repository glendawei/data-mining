POET samples 200G FR4 Transmit and Receive optical engines for QSFP56 transceivers for Cloud data centers and 5G connectivity POET Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada has begun sampling its  200G FR4 Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX) optical engines,  which are based on the POET Optical Interposer  (a unique hybrid integrated photonics packaging platform). The firm has shipped samples to multiple lead customers through  Super Photonics (its China-based joint venture formed in October 2020  with Sanan Integrated Circuit Co Ltd of Xiamen City, Fujian province)  and expects the 200G FR4 TX and RX optical engines to be in production at  Super Photonics by the end of 2022. The 200G FR4 Transmit optical engine integrates four  high-speed directly modulated lasers (DMLs), each operating at 50Gb/s speed,  with a low-loss AWG (arrayed waveguide grating)-based multiplexer that is  monolithically integrated on the Optical Interposer. Monitor photodiodes  are built into the optical engine for active power monitoring. The 200G FR4 Receive optical engine integrates four  high-speed photodetectors, each operating at 50Gb/s speed, with a low-loss  AWG-based demultiplexer that is monolithically integrated on the Optical Interposer.  A single-mode optical fiber with LC connector is attached to the TX  and RX optical engines for seamless integration in a 200GBASE-FR4  transceiver module. “We see significant customer interest in 200GBASE-FR4  transceivers,” says Raju Kankipati, VP of product line management (PLM).  “Our highly integrated optical engines will enable customers to offer  cost-effective and scalable 200GBASE-FR4 and 2x200GBASE-FR4 transceivers to  cloud data-center end customers,” he adds. “We, through our joint venture  Super Photonics, have started sampling multiple lead customers, who  we expect to work closely with through their transceiver design completion  phase.” Key features of the 200G FR4 Transmit and Receive optical engines  are listed as:
