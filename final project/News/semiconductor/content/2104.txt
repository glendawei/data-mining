Financial support from the German federal  government, the state of Baden-Württemberg and the German Federal Ministry of  Defense (BMVg) has funded construction of a new laboratory building as well as a  new hall for metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), enabling Fraunhofer IAF  to intensify its activities in optoelectronic metrology and quantum sensing  as well as materials science. “The application laboratories for quantum  sensing and laser spectroscopy significantly expand the opportunities for  cooperation with partners from industry and research,” notes Dr Martin  Walther, head of research infrastructure.
