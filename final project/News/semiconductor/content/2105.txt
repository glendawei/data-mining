Palomar places vacuum reflow furnace at UK’s EPIC Photonics and microelectronic device assembly  & packaging equipment maker Palomar Technologies Inc of Carlsbad, CA,  USA has announced the  consignment of an SST 5100 vacuum  reflow furnace at the Electronics and Photonics Innovation Centre (EPIC) in  Paignton, Torbay, UK. The focus will be on delivering higher-quality  optoelectronics packaging for several different applications. Picture:   Palomar’s SST 5100 vacuum reflow furnace. EPIC is a center of excellence supporting technological innovation  and promoting collaborative activity between businesses and research  institutions. It focuses on supporting start-up and spin-off companies and  encourages foreign direct investment to Torbay and its microelectronics and  photonics sector. Previously, Palomar has placed a 3880 die bonder and 8000 wire bonder at the EPIC Prototyping Suite,  which were subsequently purchased and are now available for use by EPIC members  and other photonics companies to use on photonics/optoelectronics projects. For the manufacture of optical transceiver engines, using the  void-free solutions delivered by the SST 5100  can deliver higher thermal conductivity, thinner bond lines and a cleaner finish. This requires changing from  epoxy bonding of a thermoelectric cooler  (TEC)-to-gold box bond — as well as for  the chip-on-chip (CoC)-to-TEC bond — to a eutectic sandwich bond process achieved with a vacuum  reflow furnace. For higher-bit-rate transceivers (over 400G to 1.6T),  supplementing ball bumping from the Palomar 8000/8100 ball bonder and flip-chip thermos-compression  bond on the Palomar 3880/3880-II die bonder with the over-pressure advantage  provided by the SST 5100 is expected  to provide the superior RF performance needed for market success.
