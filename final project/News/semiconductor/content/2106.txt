Full-color μLED pixels for displays and optical near-field communication Researchers based in China report on  all-in-one micro-light-emitting diode  pixels (μLEDPs) with  integrated red-green-blue super-pixels (RGBSPs) aimed at simultaneous display  and optical near-field communication (ONFC) capability [Xinyi Liu, et al, Optics Express, v30, p24889, 2022]. “To the best of our knowledge, the proposed  integrated μLEDP  achieves the highest data rate compared  to published results based on other multi-color, low-capacitance,  high-bandwidth LEDs,” reports the team from Hong Kong  University of Science and Technology, Southern University of Science and Technology,  and HKUST Shenzhen-Hong Kong  Collaborative Innovation Research Institute. The researchers also see potential for the μLEDPs in general lighting  applications based on a wide range of color temperatures from warm to cool  white. The researchers fabricated 100μmx200μm RGBSPs. The red super-pixels (Figure 1) were  created from aluminium gallium indium phoshide  (AlGaInP) multiple quantum wells (MQWs)  on gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate by  metal-organic chemical vapor deposition  (MOCVD). The material was then glued to sapphire and the growth substrate  removed by wet etching.
