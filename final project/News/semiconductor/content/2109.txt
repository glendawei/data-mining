Navitas powering Xiaomi’s first in-box GaN 100W laptop fast charger Gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit  firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo,  CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland says that its GaNFast power ICs with GaNSense technology are driving the  100W fast chargers supplied ‘in-box’ in the latest Redmi laptop family of  Chinese consumer electronics firm Xiaomi Corp. Founded in  2014, Navitas introduced what it claimed to be the first commercial GaN power  integrated circuits. Its proprietary GaNFast power ICs monolithically  integrate GaN power field-effect transistors (FETs) with drive, control, sensing  and protection circuits in a single SMT package. Since GaN is reckoned to run  up to 20x faster than silicon, GaNFast power ICs are said to deliver up to 3x  faster charging or 3x more power in half the size and weight for mobile,  consumer, enterprise, eMobility and new energy markets. With more than 150  Navitas patents issued or pending, over 50 million units have been shipped  with zero reported field failures. Xiaomi has adopted GaNFast technology to develop an ultra-compact,  high-power-density charger now shipping with all new Xiaomi RedmiBook Pro 14  laptops and the integrated-GPU version of the RedmiBook Pro 15. The new RedmiBook Pro 14 and Pro 15 lightweight 14” and  15” laptops are built around 12th generation Intel Core i5  and Core i7 mobile processors and are suitable for gamers and other users  requiring high-performance, portable computing power. Due to Navitas’ GaNFast  technology, the ultra-small form-factor 100W fast charger supplied  ‘in-box’ fast charges from 0-50% in less than 40 minutes.
