POET makes available 400G FR4 and 800G (2x400G FR4) receive optical engines for QSFP-DD and OSFP transceivers in cloud data centers POET Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada has announced the  availability of its 400G FR4 and 800G (2x400G FR4) receive (RX) optical engines based on the POET Optical Interposer, a unique hybrid integration  photonics packaging platform. The firm has shipped samples to multiple lead customers and  expects the 400G FR4 receive optical engine  to be in production by the end of third-quarter 2022 at Super Photonics (its China-based joint venture formed in October 2020 with Sanan Integrated Circuit Co Ltd of  Xiamen City, Fujian province). The 400G FR4 receive optical engine  integrates four 56Gigabaud photodetectors each operating at 100Gb/s speed with  a low-loss AWG (arrayed waveguide grating)-based demultiplexer that is  monolithically integrated on the Optical Interposer.  A single-mode optical fiber with LC  connector is attached to the optical engine  for seamless integration in a 400GBASE-FR4 transceiver module. “We are excited to announce the completion of design, verification  testing and availability of pre-production parts for customers to take  advantage of our highly integrated optical engines  to build 400G FR4 and 800G (2x400G FR4) transceivers,” says president Vivek  Rajgarhia. “Our small form factor  and easy-to-integrate optical engine  enables cost-effective and scalable solutions for cloud data centers. Customers can integrate a single  receive engine or dual engines in a  QSFP-DD or OSFP pluggable transceiver form factor  to achieve a 400GBASE-FR4 or 800G (2x400GBASE-FR4) solution,” he adds. “The  shipping of 400G receive samples marks a significant milestone for the company,  as we continue to commercialize multiple products and align them with the needs  of customers.” Key features of the 400G FR4 receive optical engine include:
