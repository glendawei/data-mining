Umicore develops ultra-low-resistivity 8” n-type germanium wafers Germanium product and materials solutions  supplier Umicore Electro-Optic Materials (EOM) has announced  the development of ultra-low (<1mΩ.cm) 6” and 8” germanium wafers for  vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). As a key component in telecom and  3D sensor  systems, the applications of VCSELs range from data centers  to smartphone security and light detection & ranging (LiDAR) sensors for  autonomous vehicles (AVs). Umicore says  that, due to its latest breakthrough, VCSELs on the firm’s 6” or 8” wafers will  have superior electrical performance on top of the already proven better  optical performance compared with gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafers  traditionally used for this application. “We are  seeing growing interest in our germanium wafers for photonic applications,”  notes Bendix De Meulemeester, director marketing & business  development. “Thanks to the Umicore  material expertise and know-how, our team has been able to develop an  innovative germanium crystal technology that achieves below 1mΩ.cm resistivity in n-type germanium wafers without affecting the  excellent crystal quality such as zero dislocations and high doping uniformity,” he adds. “With the development of the  first 6” VCSEL Ge wafer in 2020 and the first  8” VCSEL Ge wafer in 2021, this is the third innovation of our  germanium R&D team in relatively short time, a testament of our commitment  to the photonic industry.”
