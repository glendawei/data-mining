III-V Epi’s revenue coming mostly from high-growth industrial customers for ongoing production III-V Epi Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK says, in the last year, that most of its  revenue has come from devices supplied for industrial applications with ongoing  production requirements, demonstrating that it has met a clear need in the  global photonics industry as a trusted manufacturer of prototype and  lower-volume III-V epitaxial structures by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD). “As much as 90% of III-V Epi’s  turnover is coming from industrial customers in high-growth telecoms, datacoms,  additive manufacturing, LiDAR [light detection & ranging] and multiple  optical sensing industries,” notes director Calum McGregor. “This is great  commercially, as these customers are typically using our devices within live  product ranges with growing supply requirements. This industrial business is  also informed by the fast-turnaround academic projects that make up the  remainder of our portfolio,” he adds. “Industrial customers are using our  specialist range of design, manufacture, test and characterization services to  expedite device manufacture and bring new products to market as quickly as  possible.”
