Riber receives order for multi-4” GSMBE 49 production system Riber  S.A. of Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)  systems as well as evaporation sources and effusion cells – has received  an order for a multi-4”-wafer GSMBE 49 production system, for delivery to Asia  in 2023. The gas-source  MBE system is intended for optoelectronic and microwave applications, in  particular for the growth of 1.3µm quantum dot (QD) lasers for next-generation  datacom and telecom devices. The new generation of datacom devices requires very  high-precision control of the epitaxial growth process, achieved by the  performance of Riber’s machines and by its control software.
