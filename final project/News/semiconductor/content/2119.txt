Transphorm joins Russell 2000 and 3000 Indexes Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near  Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and  AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs)  for high-voltage power conversion — is joining the FTSE Russell 2000 and Russell 3000  Indexes at the conclusion of the Russell US Indexes annual reconstitution,  which takes effect after the day’s close of the US market. Russell indexes are part of global index provider FTSE Russell,  and are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for  index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies. About $16 trillion in assets are benchmarked  against Russell’s US indexes. “Being added to the Russell 2000 and 3000 Indexes provides greater  visibility and stature among institutional investors and signifies the value we  are creating for our shareholders,” says president & co-founder Primit  Parikh. Membership in the US all-cap Russell 3000 Index, which remains in  place for one year, means automatic inclusion in the small-cap Russell 2000 Index or the large-cap Russell 1000 Index, as well as the appropriate  growth and value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for its  Russell indexes primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings and  style attributes.
