Chalmers demos GaN power devices with >1600V breakdown and 22nA/mm leakage current on SweGaN’s QuanFINE epi New state-of-the-art  results have been reported for high-voltage GaN power devices  enabled by the MIS-HEMT technology of Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden and the QuanFINE buffer-free gallium nitride on silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC) materials of Linköping-based epitaxial wafer  foundry SweGaN AB (Björn  Hult et al, ‘High Voltage and Low Leakage  GaN-on-SiC MISHEMTs on a “Buffer-Free” Heterostructure’, IEEE Electron Device  Letters, volume 43, issue 5 (May 2022),  p781). Among key findings, the research  identifies QuanFINE epiwafers as a highly competitive candidate for  high-voltage power devices  in 1200V applications, in addition to its strong traction in the RF market  at present.
