Arralis launches K- and Ka-band analog bare die phase shifters Arralis Technologies of Limerick, Ireland – which  has a design center in Belfast and manufactures RF, microwave and  millimeter-wave devices, modules and antennas up to and beyond 110GHz (the  W-band) for aerospace/satellite and security markets – says that its K- and Ka-band analog bare die phase shifters  are now in stock and available to order. Operating at 17-21GHz or 25-33GHz, the  phase shifters enable up to 350º and  >360º smooth phase variation  across the band, respectively. Arralis’ analog phase shifters  are an alternative to digital phase shifters  where any required phase delay is  achievable, with the phase set by varying the control voltage in the range of  -0.5V to 0.7V. This smooth phase variation  is vitally important for the development of beam-steering antenna systems, says  the firm. The phase shifters have several key applications, including the  following: frequency translation; beam-steering antenna; phased arrays; 5G  networks; satellite downlinks; Internet of Things (IoT); and security. “Electronically steerable antennas are becoming an ever-increasing  necessity for the next generation of LEO [low Earth orbit] satellite constellations,” says engineer Dr Geoffrey Barigye. “These antenna have the  ability to simultaneously steer multiple beams and allow beams to be rapidly  re-positioned at speeds that are not possible with mechanically steered  antenna,” he adds. “To help antenna designers to achieve this, Arralis have  launched our new K & Ka-band phase shifters.”
