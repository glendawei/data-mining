WIN releases 0.12µm-gate RF GaN-on-SiC technology WIN Semiconductors Corp of  Taoyuan City, Taiwan – the world’s largest pure-play  compound semiconductor wafer foundry – has expanded its portfolio of RF GaN  technologies with the release of a new gallium nitride  (GaN) on silicon carbide (SiC)  0.12μm-gate technology. The NP12-01 millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology  provides increased gain and improved transistor stability factor. The NP12-01  technology is suitable for the high-power amplifiers  used in 5G mmWave radio access  networks, satellite communications, and radar systems. Supporting full monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), the NP12-01 platform  allows customers to develop compact linear or saturated power amplifiers up to 50GHz. This process is  qualified for 28V operation and, in the 29GHz band,  generates saturated output power over 4W/mm with 13.5dB linear gain and nearly 50% efficiency. When  optimized for power-added efficiency (PAE), NP12-01 provides over 3.5W/mm  output power and greater than 50% PAE at 29GHz. WIN says that higher gain and power-added efficiency provided by  the NP15-01 platform affords designers a larger trade-space to optimize  amplifier performance and chip size  to meet increasingly difficult specifications of current-generation  communication platforms and radar systems. Depending on the function, these  high-performance applications require precise optimization of output power, linearity, gain and efficiency,  and a broad trade-space is crucial to balance amplifier performance and product  cost. WIN showcased its compound semiconductor RF and mm-Wave  solutions at the 2022 IEEE International Microwave Symposium (IMS) in Denver,  CO, USA (21-23 June).
