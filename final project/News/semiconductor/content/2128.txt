Guerrilla RF launches 2.5–2.7 and 3.3-4.2GHz ¼W PAs deliver for 5G without DPD Guerrilla RF Inc (GRF) of Greensboro,  NC, USA – a provider of radio-frequency  integrated circuits (RFICs) and monolithic microwave  integrated circuits (MMICs) for wireless applications – is now  sampling the GRF5526 and GRF5536, the latest in a  series of new ¼W linear power amplifiers.  The indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) heterojunction bipolar  transistor (HBT) amplifiers were designed specifically for 5G wireless  infrastructure applications requiring exceptional native linearity over large  100MHz bandwidths and temperature extremes of -40°C to 85°C. Spanning frequency ranges of 2.5–2.7GHz and 3.3-4.2GHz  respectively, the GRF5526 and GRF5536 are tuned to operate in the n7, n30, n38,  n40, n41, n48, n53, n77, n88 and n90 5G new radio  (NR) bands. The devices typically deliver 23dBm of linear power over the entire  -40°C to 85°C temperature range while maintaining ACLR (adjacent-channel leakage ratio) levels of better than -45dBc,  IMD3 (third-order intermodulation distortion) levels  <-20dBm, EVM (error vector magnitude) levels  <1.5%, and PAE (power-added efficiency) in the 14% range – all without the  aid of supplemental linearization schemes like digital pre-distortion (DPD). The ability to beat the -45dBc ACLR performance metric without DPD  is critical for cellular applications like home and commercial  repeaters/boosters, femtocells and picocells, as well as cable loss compensators which are used in  conjunction with automotive ‘shark fin’ antennas. In each of these use cases, the sensitivity to cost, power and  size constraints prohibits the use of elaborate linearization techniques like  DPD. Instead, designers must rely on the power amplifier’s  native linearity to meet the stringent emissions mask requirements imposed by  the latest 5G standards. During the development of the GRF55xx series, Guerrilla RF consulted directly with its customers  to ensure that the devices delivered the best blend of power and linearity,  maximizing the effective range and throughput for their cellular systems. The  firm also designed the family of devices to be fully footprint compatible,  enabling its customer base to rapidly customize their designs for a myriad of  cellular frequencies. “With the addition of the GRF5526 and GRF5536, GRF has now  completely filled out its portfolio of ¼W PAs for cellular applications,” says  CEO & founder Ryan Pratt. “The entire family of InGaP HBT PAs has proven to  be extremely popular with our cellular repeater and automotive customers, and  we expect these latest additions to be key enablers as our customers update  their designs to accommodate for the newest 5G frequency bands.” The GRF5526 and GRF5536 come in pin-compatible 3mm x 3mm,  16-pin QFN packages. Samples and evaluation boards are available now. Prices  start at $1.78 (in 10,000-unit quantities, EXW USA).
