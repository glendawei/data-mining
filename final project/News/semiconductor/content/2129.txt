Sivers completes integration of MixComm Sivers Semiconductors AB of Kista, Sweden  (which supplies chips and integrated modules) has completed the integration of fabless semiconductor company  MixComm Inc of Chatham, NJ, USA (which also has design centers  in Oregon and California), creating a global provider in 5G, SATCOM and radar. Along with  broadening Sivers’ portfolio and increasing its presence in the USA, the  integration entails synergies of about SEK10m per year. Sivers writes down  intangible assets of about SEK22m due to overlapping product development areas.  The firm is also introducing a new role in the USA, making former MixComm CEO  Mike Noonen its US president. Sivers has found large synergies in development tools and some  personnel, yielding a total saving of about SEK10m per year (compared with if  MixComm and Sivers had been two autonomous units). At the end of first-quarter  2022, Sivers had 137 staff, which includes personnel synergies. Sivers Wireless has minimal product overlap with MixComm. However,  there is a one product, a beam-forming IC (BFIC), that Sivers and MixComm had  both independently developed, where Sivers has determined that MixComm’s BIFC  is the most sophisticated solution. Sivers has therefore chosen to write down  intangible assets of about SEK22m for the product that Sivers Wireless  developed. “MixComm’s  key area has been BFICs, where MixComm founder Harish Krishnaswamy and his team  had invested many years in optimizing technology at Columbia University with  significant DARPA support,” notes Sivers Semiconductors’ CEO Anders  Storm. “This  technology is ‘state-of-the-art’, and the one we will continue to develop  within BFIC and later also RFICs,” he adds. As US president in the new organization, Noonen will focus on  business development and sales for both Sivers Wireless and Photonics. During a  transition period, he will also be managing director  (MD) of Sivers Wireless. Pelle Wijk will take on a new role as chief operating officer (COO) of Sivers Wireless. Patric  Erlandsson, former VP sales of  Sivers Wireless, becomes senior VP  marketing for the parent company Sivers Semiconductors. Sivers Wireless will be divided into two different development  units, one in the USA which will be run by MixComm’s co-founder & former  chief technology officer Dr Harish  Krishnaswamy, and one in the EU which will be run by Magnus Sneitz, previously  head of the Project Management  Office (PMO) at Sivers Wireless. “With  MixComm now fully integrated, we now have a much stronger presence in the US,  and I am very happy that Mike Noonen is taking on this new role,” says Storm. “He has a network in the  USA that is top tier and is very well  known in the semiconductor industry," he adds. MixComm was founded in 2017 based on more than 10 years  of development at Columbia University led by Krishnaswamy through externally  funded research projects totalling $94m. The firm is an active US participant in 5G BFIC  (repeaters/base stations), SATCOM  and radar verticals. Most employees hold a PhD and the company is the only  mmWave company selected to join the 5G Open Innovation  Lab founded by T-Mobile and Intel. The flagship beam-forming IC SUMMIT 2629 was  the recipient of numerous ‘Best Products’  citations in 2020, including ‘The Broadband  Innovation of the Year’ from the Mobile Breakthrough  Awards. MixComm has established partnerships with minority investor GlobalFoundries  for RF-SOI fabrication, packaging and test services, and with Richardson RFPD for distribution and logistics  globally. Both the GlobalFoundries and Richardson RFPD  collaborations will continue under the Sivers Wireless brand and be expanded to  all products by the company.
