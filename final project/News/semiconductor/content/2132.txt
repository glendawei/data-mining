Wise-integration launches compact 120mΩ GaN half-bridge power IC Wise-integration of  Meylan, France, which was  founded in 2020 and specializes in the digital control of gallium nitride  (GaN) power supplies and GaN integrated circuits, has launched its  first commercial product: the 120mΩ WI62120  half-bridge power circuit, which is claimed to provide  power electronics designers with new levels of power density, performance  and cost-effectiveness. The JEDEC-certified WI62120, a 650V  enhancement-mode GaN-on-silicon IC, is part of Wise-integration’s WiseGan  family of power devices. It leverages the intrinsic properties of GaN to  provide improved current capabilities, voltage breakdown and switching  frequencies for applications in high-efficiency and high-density power  conversion, including AC/DC, DC/DC and DC/AC, from 30W to 3kW. Target market sectors include consumer  (such as ultra-fast chargers for mobile and desktop devices), E-mobility and  industrial AC/DC power supplies and designs utilizing bridgeless  totem pole power factor conversion (PFC) active clamp flyback  (ACF), two-inductor one-capacitor (LLC) resonant converters, and synchronous  buck or boost half-bridge topologies. “The 120mΩ  WI62120 is the most compact half-bridge in the market, with a 6x8 PQFN package  that maximizes customer benefits in terms of high power density,  performance, and bill-of-materials cost reduction,” claims CEO Thierry Bouchet.  “We’re confident that our customers will find it very useful in all ACF  topologies and PFC-LCC architectures, and that it will help them leverage the  benefits provided by smaller, more efficient and more cost-effective power  electronics.” Wise-integration says that, with its  WiseWare embedded digital control software; subsequent generations of  WiseGan devices will integrate functions such as gate control, protection,  security and other designer-friendly capabilities into AC/DC GaN applications.
