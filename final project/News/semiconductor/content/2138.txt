MACOM extends PURE CARBIDE GaN-on-SiC power amplifier range to 7kW At  the IEEE International Microwave Symposium (IMS 2022) in Denver, CO,  USA (21-23 June), MACOM Technology  Solutions Inc of Lowell, MA, USA (which designs and makes analog RF,  microwave, millimeter-wave and photonic semiconductors, components and  subassemblies) has announced that it has expanded its power amplifier product portfolio with the  MAPC-A1605 7.0 kilowatt power amplifier, suitable for high-power and  high-voltage aerospace and defense applications, including radar and electronic warfare (EW) systems. The MAPC-A1605 can operate at 960-1215MHz and currently represents  MACOM’s highest-power-level RF amplifier  component product. This extremely high power level  was achieved by combining novel high-voltage circuit topologies with advanced  packaging materials for improved thermal management. The MAPC-A1605 utilizes  MACOM PURE CARBIDE gallium nitride-on-silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC) technology and operates at 150V bias  levels. MACOM has also introduced the MAPC-A1603 and MAPC-A1604, which  operate at similar frequencies but lower voltages and lower output powers of 3.3kW and 5.0kW, respectively.  Previously, MACOM’s highest-power amplifier was the MAPC-A1500, operating at  2.6kW. “Our customers want to transmit higher power levels and these new  amplifiers will help enable that,” notes president & CEO Stephen G. Daly.
