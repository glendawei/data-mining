Tagore launches GaAs pHEMT ultra-low-noise amplifiers and linear PA driver Fabless  semiconductor company Tagore Technology Inc –  which was founded in January 2021 and has design centers in Arlington Heights,  IL, USA and Kolkata, India developing gallium nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) technology for RF and  power management applications – has launched ultra-low-noise amplifiers  (LNA) and a companion linear power amplifier (PA) driver. Tunable from  100MHz to 5GHz and operating from a 2.7-5V supply, the family of devices is  suitable for a broad range of applications including 5G infrastructure and  high-performance Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS). The TL0374J and TL0375J are ultra-low noise figure LNAs  utilizing pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (pHEMT) gallium arsenide  (GaAs) process technology. The TL0374J is optimized for below 3GHz frequency  bands and the TL0375J is optimized for above 3GHz frequency bands. Ultra-low  noise figure LNAs offer a noise figure of 0.35dB and gain of 18dB  with adjustable bias current through an external resistor. The TP0310K is  a linear PA driver with gain of 17dB, OP1dB of 27dBm and OIP3 of 39dBm at 2GHz. “The new ultra-low-noise amplifier and linear PA driver  device deliver a very low NF, high linearity and good gain required for  high-performance receivers such as 5G infrastructure and SDARS,” says chief  sales & marketing officer Klaus Buehring. “Our applications team has developed  custom tuning for a broad range of applications at 5V/60mA and 3V/30mA bias for  common cellular band frequencies which can be adopted by our customers.” The ultra-low-noise amplifiers are available in a 2x2 DFN package  and the linear PA driver is available in a compact 3mm x 3mm QFN  package. Samples and evaluation boards are available now for all devices.
