The  initiative was set up to discuss and address the barriers faced by minority  groups in Scotland’s photonics sector, aiming to increase accessibility and  champion diversity. The newly appointed Steering Board  members have diverse experience of the Scottish photonics sector with  industrial, academic, human resources  (HR) and business development  expertise. They will provide strategic guidance for increased inclusivity –  broadening the talent pool, driving innovation, and encouraging growth. “Vector Photonics has backed the OUP initiative since its  formation and strongly supports its inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity  agenda,” says Vector Photonics’ CEO Neil Martin. “Sharon Doonin brings current  HR, corporate governance, project and quality management experience to the  Steering Board. The managerial roles she has held within large energy,  construction and insurance companies brings an even wider perspective,” he  adds. “We are also pleased that Adam McKenzie, working as a research associate at the University of Glasgow on  a PhD project with Vector Photonics, is also joining the Steering Board,” Martin  notes.
