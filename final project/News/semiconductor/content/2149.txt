Filtronic launches E-band mmWave active diplexers with integral PAs and LNAs Filtronic plc of  Sedgefield and Leeds, UK — which designs and manufactures RF, microwave and  millimeter-wave (mmWave) components and subsystems — has launched the Hades range of active  diplexers, designed to enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to  manufacture cost-effective E-band radios with significantly increased RF  performance, for use in military or commercial telecoms applications, including  airborne and High Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS). The active E-band mmWave diplexers operate over the 71–76GHz and  81–86GHz bands, and offer a range of configurable options integrating  high power amplifiers (PAs) and low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), reducing  size and weight compared with discrete components. Their low overall SWAP  (size, weight and power) makes them suitable for airborne and HAPS  applications. Active diplexers can be used in conjunction with a wide range of  commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) surface-mount-compatible packaged  upconverters and downconverters. This provides enhanced performance compared  with using surface-mount products, and allows versatility in the deployment of  configurable E-band links with different power levels. The integral PAs have saturated transmitter (Tx) power output  levels up to more than +30dBm, and incorporate a Tx RF power detector to  facilitate power calibration and automatic level control (ALC). The LNAs  have a receiver (Rx) noise figure of less than 4dB. With a typical output  IP3 (third-order intercept point) at  +20dBm of +31dBm, the high linearity of the units are capable of supporting  modulation formats up to 1024QAM to facilitate very high data rates.
