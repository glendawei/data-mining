5N Plus renews $124m syndicated credit facility Specialty semiconductor and performance materials  producer 5N Plus Inc of Montreal, Québec, Canada has announced the renewal of its US$124m  senior secured multi-currency revolving syndicated credit facility. Subject to lenders’ approval, 5N Plus can opt to increase its credit  facility to $154m through a $30m accordion feature. 5N Plus provides  purified metals such as bismuth, gallium, germanium, indium, selenium and  tellurium, and also produces related II-VI semiconducting compounds such as  cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium sulphide (CdS) and indium antimonide (InSb)  as precursors for the growth of crystals for solar, LED and eco-friendly  materials applications. Sectors addressed include renewable energy, security,  space, pharmaceutical, medical imaging, and industrial and additive  manufacturing. “In late 2021, supported by our senior lending partners, we  completed the acquisition of Germany-based AZUR SPACE GmbH [which  develops and manufactures multi-junction solar cells based on III-V  compound semiconductor materials], significantly strengthening our  specialty semiconductor value chain  and competitive capabilities in a critical sector, thereby also expanding our  addressable market,” says chief financial officer  Richard Perron. “5N Plus has a  growing and resilient business with a greater proportion of revenues driven by  value-added products and promising end markets,”  he adds. “We are pleased to have the continued support of leading financial  institutions to fund our operations and growth initiatives as we pursue our  growth trajectory.” The new credit facility has a four-year term, bearing interest and  a margin based on the firm’s senior consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio. HSBC Bank Canada acted as sole lead arranger,  sole bookrunner and administrative agent for the syndicate of five lenders  participating in the credit facility.
