IQE commits to net zero carbon neutrality by 2050 Epiwafer and substrate  maker IQE plc of Cardiff, UK has announced a formal commitment to net zero carbon neutrality across its operations by 2050, in  accordance with the Science Based  Targets initiative (SBTi). As part of this commitment, IQE will  formulate science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the SBTi Net Zero Standard, which seeks to limit  global warming to 1.5°C. The SBTi defines and promotes best practice in  emissions reductions and net zero targets  in line with climate science. IQE and its board remain committed to the  implementation of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) best practice  across the group. The announcement marks a step for IQE’s ESG Committee  following its establishment in January, as it continues to build on IQE’s  strategy to deliver sustainable growth. The board-level group oversees ESG  activities and performance against commitments for the long-term benefit of all  stakeholders. “This  commitment is an important milestone for IQE in our journey towards improving  our own operations, delivering sustainable growth and being a truly responsible  business for the benefit of all,” says CEO Americo Lemos. “The world’s net zero  targets will not be met without the  widespread uptake of compound semiconductors, which are vital in enabling  next-generation efficient technologies, such as those needed for the mass  adoption of electric vehicles, in the power electronics  industry and smart power grids.’’
