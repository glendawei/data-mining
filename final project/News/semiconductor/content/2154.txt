III-V Epi completes SHARK-VECSEL project for University of Strathclyde III-V Epi Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK has completed the project SHARK-VECSELs  (Supply cHAin for stRontium clocK Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers) with the University of Strathclyde. Funded by UK Government agency Innovate UK (which  provides funding and support for business innovation as part of UK Research and  Innovation), the £50,000 project has developed high-power,  narrow-linewidth visible lasers for next-generation strontium-atom-based  quantum atomic clocks.  “The SHARK-VECSELs project represents a significant developmental  step in the commercialization of atomic-clock-based precision positioning and  timing devices,” says Dr Jennifer  Hastie, director of the Institute of Photonics at Strathclyde University.  “III-V Epi used its MOCVD  [metal-organic chemical vapor deposition]  facility to produce an aluminium gallium indium phosphide  (AlGaInP)-based VECSEL structure, which the University of Strathclyde used to  realise lasers with greater than 130mW single-mode operation, at 689nm. This is  the wavelength used to cool neutral strontium atoms in quantum atomic clocks.” Quantum technologies play a mission-critical role in defence,  security and other sensitive markets, but require low-volume production  quantities. III-V Epi was set up  specifically to address the needs of this low-volume, fast-turnaround market.  The SHARK-VECSELs project has helped to consolidate III-V Epi’s critical position in the worldwide  commercial quantum supply chain, the  firm reckons.
