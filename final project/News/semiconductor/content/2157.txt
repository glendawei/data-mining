Perovskiteâ€“GaN tandem LED with improved tunable luminance and color In conventional display  panels, the red, green and blue sub-pixels are assembled in a side-by-side  structure, which intrinsically leads to a large pixel area,  making it difficult to fulfill the requirements of applications requiring  ultra-high display resolution, e.g. advanced high-dynamic-range (HDR) and virtual-reality  (VR) displays, notes the South China  University of Technology. An efficient approach to reducing the pixel area is  to combine two (or even three) colors (red, green or blue) within one  sub-pixel. However, this requires excellent color tunability for the lighting  device. To meet this demand, multi-color electroluminescence (EL) devices with  a tandem structure are becoming a straightforward solution to improve space  utilization. In particular,  tandem structures with different subpixels are promising for perovskite-based  multi-color EL devices in ultra-high-resolution full-color displays. However,  considering the low brightness and stability of blue perovskite light-emitting  diodes (PeLEDs), realizing excellent luminance- and color-independent tunability  remains a challenge.
