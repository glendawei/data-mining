BluGlass ships first prototype laser diode products BluGlass Ltd of Silverwater, Australia – which has developed proprietary  low-temperature, low-hydrogen remote-plasma chemical vapor deposition  (RPCVD) technology for manufacturing devices such as laser diodes,  next-generation LEDs and micro-LEDs – has shipped its first fully packaged  laser diode prototypes to its initial customer. BluGlass’ 405nm and 420nm alpha products (for collecting customer  feedback in real-world applications) will be integrated and tested by the  customer within their new product design and development cycles. These alpha products have undergone internal preliminary performance and  life-time reliability testing and are at a stage where customers can assess the  products in their own development-stage applications. BluGlass’ 405nm and 420nm  single-mode and multi-mode products are progressing towards achieving  commercial performance and reliability. “This is a key commercialization milestone for BluGlass, representing  the first delivery of our laser diodes to an external customer,” notes BluGlass’  president Jim Haden. “While still in the alpha (development) stage, our laser  products are demonstrating significantly improved performance, and now are  suitable for customers to evaluate during their product and application  development process,” he adds. “We are working with several customers wanting  to trial alpha laser diodes for innovative new applications, including  medical devices, sensing, quantum computing, and automotive products. The  fact that we have customers anxious to receive our alpha products, ahead of our  full product launch, is indicative of the significant unmet demand within  the 405nm and 420nm wavelengths, and a testament of our improved performance.”
