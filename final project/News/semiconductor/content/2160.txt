VIGO’s IR detectors selected for environmental system monitoring on NASA’s Orion spacecraft VIGO Photonics of Ożarów Mazowiecki, Poland says that its  infrared detector products have been selected to monitor critical environmental  systems – namely the Laser Air Monitor System (LAMS) crew habitable  environment spectrometer instrument – on board NASA’s Orion spacecraft. Part of  the Artemis program, Orion  will serve as the exploration vehicle that will carry the crew to space,  provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during the space travel,  and provide safe re-entry from deep space  return velocities. Orion will launch on NASA’s new heavy-lift rocket, the Space  Launch System.
