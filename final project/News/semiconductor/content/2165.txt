Power GaN device market growing at 59% CAGR to $2bn in 2027 The power gallium nitride  (GaN) device market is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of  59% from just $126m in 2021 to $2bn in 2027, estimates market research and  strategy consulting company Yole Développement in the latest edition of its annual  report ‘Power GaN 2022’.  In particular, the consumer sector (including  power supplies and Class D audio amplifiers) is growing at a 52%  CAGR  from  $79.6m in 2021 to $964.7m in 2027 (comprising 48% of the total market). “GaN fast chargers are growing rapidly in the handset  market,” notes Taha Ayari Ph.D.,  technology & market analyst, compound semiconductors, at Yole. “Since 2020, Yole has seen an increasing  number of fast chargers  featuring GaN devices from several players, like Power Integrations, Navitas and GaN Systems. Now, Innoscience is also  contributing to this market with high volumes.” For datacoms/telecoms, Yole expects an  increase in GaN penetration in the mid-term as regulations become stricter. The  interest in adopting 48V point-of-load systems in data centers to reduce  power consumption and cabling volume will favor GaN for low-voltage  applications. An increasing number of power supply firms are adopting GaN  in their systems. Transphorm, EPC, Texas Instruments, Infineon and GaN Systems  have all announced several design wins. Therefore, the GaN device market for the  datacom/telecom sector is estimated to be growing at a 69% CAGR from $26.7m in  2021 to $617.8m in 2027. At a lower penetration level, automotive DC-DC converters and on-board chargers  (OBCs)  will be part of the next wave of growth during the forecast period, reckons  Yole. There are ever more collaborations between GaN device players, who  are accelerating the automotive qualification of their products, and the tier-1  and original equipment manufacturer  (OEMs),  who are evaluating automotive GaN solutions. The GaN automotive/mobility sector  is estimated to be growing at a 97% CAGR from $5.3m in 2021 to $308.9m in 2027. The Power GaN 2022 report also highlights the dynamic supply chain,  with new entrants and significant investments. Indeed, since the release of the  2021 report, Yole has seen the entry of new players into the supply chain.  Notably, ROHM is offering a 150V GaN product for telecom/datacom applications  as part of its new EcoGaN portfolio. New GaN foundry BelGaN has recently  acquired onsemi’s fab in Belgium. On the fundraising front, Navitas went public  through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) business combination after an  agreement valued at $1.04bn with Live Oak Acquisition Corp.  Focusing on the Chinese ecosystem, the government has supported more  investments from GaN players. Notably, privately owned company Innoscience is  investing more than $400m to expand its 8-inch wafer capacity from 10,000 to  70,000 wafers per month by 2025. A domestic supply chain for GaN  power is well developed, especially for the consumer market. In terms of technology, 6-inch GaN-on-silicon  is still the mainstream platform. However, the transition to the 8-inch  platform plus consolidation of the supply chain with more players at each  level are driving lower manufacturing costs, especially at the epitaxy step,  which constitutes the most significant part of a GaN device’s cost structure,  notes Yole. In fact, one of the big questions is around the use of in-house  epitaxy versus outsourced epitaxy for future high volumes, the report concludes.
