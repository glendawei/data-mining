RF GaN device market growth slowed to 10% in 2021 as Huawei ends buffering of trade sanctions Revenue growth from RF GaN-enabled devices  slowed down in 2021, but still managed to increase by 10%, according to the  Strategy Analytics Advanced Semiconductor Applications (ASA) and  Advanced Defense Systems (ADS) report ‘RF GaN Device Market  Forecast: 2021-2026’. Base-station applications continue to be the largest  source of RF GaN device revenue but this segment declined in 2021, while  defense applications drove overall revenue growth in 2021, the report concludes.  However, it forecasts that a return to growth from base stations, coupled  with defense applications, will push total RF GaN device revenue past  $2.1bn in 2026.

  “The  past few years have seen extraordinary growth in RF GaN device revenue in base-station applications as a result  of Huawei trying to buffer the consequences of trade sanctions, but this effort  has ended,” notes Eric Higham, director of the Advanced Semiconductor Applications (ASA) and Advanced  Defense Systems (ADS)  services. “Despite a slight drop in base-station revenue in 2021, I expect this  segment will return to growth and will be a growth engine, along with expanding  defense applications to power RF GaN  device revenue past $2.1bn in 2026.”
