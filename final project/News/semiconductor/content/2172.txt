Navitas highlights long-term partnership and record GaN shipments at TSMC Technology Symposium Gallium nitride (GaN) power IC firm  Navitas Semiconductor Corp  of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland  has announced its participation on 16 June  in Santa Clara, CA, at the 2022  North America Technology Symposium  of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). Since GaN runs 20 times faster than traditional silicon, gallium nitride chargers can achieve 3x the power  or 3x faster charging with up to 40% energy savings in just half the size and  weight compared with traditional silicon chargers. GaNFast power ICs with GaNSense technology integrate  GaN power with drive, control, protection and sensing circuitry to enable  faster charging, higher power density  and greater energy savings for  mobile, consumer, enterprise, eMobility and new-energy markets. “GaN semiconductors are becoming increasingly important for fast  charging and power conversion that drive energy efficiency to the next level,”  notes Lucas Tsai, director of market development  and emerging business management,  TSMC North America. “We’re very  pleased with the results of our long-term partnership with Navitas in delivery  of high-quality, reliable GaN semiconductors using our industry-leading GaN  manufacturing technology and platform, and we look forward to our continuous  collaboration with Navitas to unleash more green and sustainable innovations.” At the TSMC 2022 NA Technology Symposium, Navitas is demonstrating  its GaN fast and ultra-fast mobile charging, plus displaying higher-power  system hardware including data-center and electric vehicle  (EV) applications at its booth in the Innovation Zone, which spotlights the  achievements of TSMC’s emerging startup customers. “Navitas’ partnership with TSMC goes back over a decade, and for  me personally, long before that,” says Navitas’ chief operating officer (COO)/chief technology officer (CTO) & co-founder Dan Kinzer.  “Excellent teamwork, learning and collaboration has created a proven,  high-yielding platform on which Navitas can build next-generation GaNFast power ICs via GaN-on-Si fabricated by TSMC.”
