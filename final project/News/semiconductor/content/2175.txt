Tower showcasing key process and PDK features of silicon photonics process Specialty analog foundry Tower  Semiconductor Ltd of Migdal Haemek, Israel says that on 28 June its technology and design enablement  experts will host a webinar ‘Develop and Verify Designs Using a Silicon Photonics Platform with Integrated Lasers’ introducing  key process and process design kit (PDK) features of its PH18 process (Session 1  – China 11am, Japan 12pm; Session 2  – USA PST 9am, Europe (Germany) 6pm).  The webinar requires advanced registration. Attendees will see a demonstration of an end-to-end design flow using Synopsys products for photonic  integrated circuit (PIC) design  together with Tower’s silicon photonics  platform which includes OpenLight’s technology with indium phosphide (InP)-based integrated lasers,  amplifiers, modulators and photodetectors. The platform targets datacom,  telecom, light detection & ranging (LiDAR), healthcare, high-performance  computing (HPC), artificial intelligence  (AI), and optical computing applications. As the optical transceiver market moves from 400Gb/s to 800Gb/s,  many complex analog components are required to assemble energy-efficient and  cost-effective optical modules. The webinar will examine an 800G-DR8 PIC design  case study to show how to accurately  develop PIC designs with a focus on co-simulating and synthesizing an  integrated laser. The webinar showcases key process and PDK features of Tower’s PH18  process along with OpenLight’s silicon photonics  platform with integrated lasers and what is reckoned to be the industry’s only  unified electronic and photonic design solution consisting of Synopsys’  OptoCompiler, OptSim, PrimeSim and IC Validator  products. These solutions and techniques help to improve performance and  scalability, while reducing the cost of design for some of the world’s  fastest-growing markets. The 800G-DR8 PIC example can be extrapolated to  develop PICs for other applications that can benefit from silicon photonics.
