Midsummer finalizes installation of UNO thin-film solar cell R&D tool at University of New South Wales Midsummer AB of Järfälla, near Stockholm, Sweden – a provider of turnkey  production lines as well as flexible, lightweight copper indium gallium  diselenide (CIGS) thin-film solar panels for building-integrated photovoltaics  (BIPV) – has finalized installation of its unique UNO  machine for thin-film solar cell research at the  University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia (home  to the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering), where it will  be used to develop a new type of tandem solar cell.  Picture: Midsummer’s UNO tool at the  University  of New South Wales. Sold to UNSW a  little over a year ago, the UNO research tool has now passed the site acceptance test  (SAT) in Sydney, confirming that it is officially installed and delivered to  the customer. With the successful SAT, Midsummer has invoiced the customer for  the final payment of the machine. Delivery and  installation were hit by some delays due to closed borders related to Covid  restrictions but, once those were lifted, Midsummer delivered according to  plan. Midsummer’s  UNO is a generic R&D tool for the production of thin-film solar cells, and is used for solar cell research at universities, among  other things. Results from it are said to be simple to implement for commercial  production with Midsummer’s DUO machinery.
