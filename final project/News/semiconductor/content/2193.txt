GaN Systems makes available GaN transistor ADS models for ISM RF power GaN Systems Inc of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of  gallium nitride-based power switching semiconductors for power conversion and  control applications) has announced availability of its  GaN transistor ADS (Advanced Design System)  models to facilitate customer ease-of-use in RF power markets  traditionally dominated by expensive silicon LDMOS and other RF power  technologies. By replacing these existing devices with GaN Systemsâ€™  power semiconductors at frequencies of typically 13-81MHz, customers can  benefit from high power output and efficiency while reducing the size and  at about 1/3 the cost of their existing solutions, the firm says.
