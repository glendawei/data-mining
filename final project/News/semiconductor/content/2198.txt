Elevation launches high-voltage power conversion ICs Elevation Semiconductor of Irvine, CA, USA,  a high-voltage power conversion solutions developer founded in 2021, has  launched two high-efficiency power ICs with smaller footprints for  fast-charging solutions. Part of the integrated GaN switch family of devices with  ultra-efficient GaN high-performance controller ICs for switched-mode  power supplies (SMPS), the HL9550/52/54 support QR, DCM, CCM and multiple  frequency hybrid-mode operations. The various 300kHz/225kHz/129kHz/82kHz  frequency options provide a possibility of flexible design for optimizing the  transformersâ€™ size and EMI performance, offering efficient and compact 20-65W  charger solutions. The charger solution can cover a wide range of VDD  operations without an additional clamp circuit for USB PD applications, as  it helps to save bill-of-materials (BOM) cost and PCB space. For protection,  they include the LPS function to limit input power and to avoid unexpected  overpowering that would damage the system when the PD controller has failed. The HL9701 synchronous rectifier (SR) is a high-performance  controller IC for switched-mode power supplies dedicated to the secondary  side of flyback converters. It drives the SR MOSFET and is compatible with  high/low-side applications for QR, DCM and CCM operations. The HL9701 intelligently  rectifies for secondary current, providing proprietary transient judgment to  complete fast turn on/off control for maximum efficiency and high  reliability at any load compared with the conventional ultra-fast diode or  Schottky diode.
