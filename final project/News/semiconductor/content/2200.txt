Magnesium doping of hot-wall MOCVD GaN Researchers based in Sweden and Iceland  report on the growth of p-type magnesium-doped gallium nitride (p-GaN:Mg) using  hot-wall metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) [A.  Papamichail et al, J. Appl. Phys., v131, p185704, 2022].  The growth technique has been shown to provide “superior III-nitride material  quality and high-performance devices,” according to the team from Linköping University, University  of Iceland, Chalmers University of Technology, Hitachi Energy  Sweden, SweGaN AB, and Lund University.  The researchers point out that up to now there have been no reported studies of  the capability of hot-wall MOCVD to deliver high-quality GaN:Mg layers with  p-type conductivity. The optimizing of p-type doped material is  a key step toward GaN-based power diodes, vertical transistors, and normally-off high-electron-mobility  transistors (HEMTs). The hot-wall MOCVD technique was found to enable p-type  GaN even without the usual annealing process used to drive out hydrogen  incorporated during the growth process, which passivates the ability of Mg to  act as an acceptor.
