Transphorm’s quarterly revenue doubles year-on-year to record $4.93m For its fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 (ended 31 March), Transphorm Inc of  Goleta, near Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures  JEDEC- and AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride  (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion applications — has reported revenue of $4.93m, up on $4.6m last quarter and up 103% on $2.4m a year ago. In particular,  product revenue grew sequentially for the ninth consecutive quarter to a new record  of over $4m, up 10% on last quarter and 190% on a year ago, due to ramping  shipments of GaN devices for a broad range of power conversion  applications. Full-year revenue grew  89% year-on-year from $12.7m in fiscal 2020 to a new record of $24.1m for  fiscal 2022, due to 189% growth in product revenue, based on prior targeted  investments in designs for a broader market. “The demand for our  GaN solutions is strong, driven by our products’ unique, easy-to-interface  architecture, world-leading GaN product portfolio with a broad range of power  capabilities from 45W to 5kW, and leading performance with field reliability,”  says president & co-founder Primit Parikh. During the quarter, Transphorm: On a non-GAAP basis,  operating expenses in fiscal Q4/2022 were $4.6m, up from $4.4m last quarter and  $4.5m a year ago. Full-year operating expenses rose from $15.6m in fiscal 2021  to $18.1m for fiscal 2022.

Full-year net loss was  cut from $15.5m ($0.42 per share) in fiscal 2021 to $10m ($0.22 per share) in  fiscal 2022. Cash, cash equivalents  and restricted cash have hence fallen during the quarter from $41m to $34m (albeit  this is still up from $9.5m a year ago, after completing equity  financing totalling more than $45m during fiscal Q3). “During the 2022  fiscal year we completed an uplisting to the NASDAQ [under the ticker symbol  TGAN], dramatically improving the company’s liquidity,” notes chief financial  officer Cameron McAulay. “Along with the additional capital we raised in fiscal  Q3 of 2022, this provides expanded operational flexibility in support of our  future anticipated growth.” “With a strong  backlog in place, our current focus is on managing supply chain  constraints, expanding our manufacturing capacity, and continuing to grow our  ecosystem of solution partners,” concludes Parikh.
