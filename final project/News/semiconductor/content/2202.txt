Nitride Semiconductors settles UV-LED patent litigation against Digi-Key Japan’s Nitride  Semiconductors Co Ltd (which was spun off from Tokushima University  in 2000) has entered into a settlement with global electrical components  distributor Digi-Key Corp. Nitride filed the patent litigation  against Digi-Key in the US District Court for the District of  Minnesota, asserting infringement of its ultraviolet light-emitting diode  (UV-LED) patent. In collaboration with professor emeritus  Shiro Sakai at Tokushima University, Nitride developed what it claims was the  first high-efficiency UV-LED as early as 2000. It has since continued to  manufacture and sell UV-LED products, and says that it has invested heavily in  R&D to develop and enhance its UV-LED technology. To  protect its UV-LED patented technology, Nitride initiated its patent  enforcement campaign starting in 2017. Subsequently, in 2020, a judgment was  issued by the US District Court for the Northern District of California  against RayVio Corp for infringing Nitride’s UV-LED patent. That judgment  was also in Nitride’s favor with respect to the validity of its patent. The US  Patent & Trademark Office has also confirmed the validity of the key claims  of Nitride’s patent in its final judgment on an Inter Parte Review  case filed by RayVio. Further,  patent lawsuits against Lite-On Technology Corp and Crystal IS Inc  are pending in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas and  in the US District Court for the Northern District of New York,  respectively, where Nitride is trying to enforce its UV-LED patent. Nitride says that, since it considers its  intellectual property rights to be vitally important company assets, it will  take any action necessary to enforce its patent against infringers in any  country and uphold its patents and other intellectual property rights.
