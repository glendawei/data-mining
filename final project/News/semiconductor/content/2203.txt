Lumileds launches LUXEON HL1Z CSP LED LED maker Lumileds LLC  of San Jose, CA, USA says that its newest high-power CSP LED – the LUXEON HL1Z – is an un-domed,  single-sided emitter that delivers high luminous efficacy (137lm/W or more)  from a very small package just 1.4mm square. The top emission prevents ‘cross-talk’ and contributes to the  superior color-over-angle performance and color consistency. Compactness and  directional emission allow engineers to create tight arrays and precisely  control the beam, which enables smaller optical solutions and a path for system  cost reduction, says the firm. The LUXEON HL1Z is particularly suitable for  high-center-beam candle power  applications such as high-end retail spots, tunable white solutions,  after-market automotive, and other high-density array lighting. “Demand for the next generation of high-power LEDs is increasing  as the need for higher intensity,  beam steering, compact arrays, color tuning, and high-center-beam candle power solutions become the drivers of new applications,”  says product manager Alvin Yeoh. Lumileds says it pioneered the high-power LED space more than 20 years ago with LUXEON, and the company  continues to develop new and differentiated solutions like the LUXEON HL1Z for  lighting solution manufacturers. “Lighting engineers are taking full advantage of the light output to size ratio that’s unique to LEDs,” says  Yeoh. “Emitters like HL1Z provide new design freedom without sacrificing  quality or efficacy.” The LUXEON HL1Z is available immediately through Lumileds  distribution network in correlated color temperatures  (CCTs) from 3000K to 6500K and color rendering  indexes (CRIs) of 80 and 90. Additional CCT/CRI combinations will follow  over the coming months and are available for pre-order.
