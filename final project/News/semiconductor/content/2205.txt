Aixtron expands MOCVD market share to 75% in 2021 Deposition equipment maker Aixtron SE of  Herzogenrath, near Aachen, Germany says that it was able to expand its  market share in metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) in  2021 and is the largest supplier of MOCVD tools worldwide for the sixth  consecutive year. According to the report ‘Semiconductor Wafer Fab  Equipment, Worldwide, 2021’ issued  in April 2022 by market research firm Gartner, Aixtron  held a 75% share of the market, while competitors from China and the USA had  significantly lower market shares of 14% and 11%, respectively. At the same  time, the global market for MOCVD tools grew by 28% from $438m in 2020 to $561m  in 2021. Aixtron’s equipment is used in the production of power semiconductors made of gallium nitride (GaN) or silicon carbide (SiC), lasers for 3D sensing and optical data communication,  and in the production of red LEDs.  Increasingly, it is also being used in the manufacture of micro-LEDs. The firm notes that its growth is being driven by the  megatrends of sustainability, digitalization and electrification. “Aixtron has put a clear  focus on MOCVD technology for compound semiconductors  in the last years,” notes CEO Dr Felix  Grawert. “These devices offer immense advantages over traditional silicon-based  semiconductors,” he adds. “As a result, the devices produced on our equipment  are conquering more and more new areas of application. This opens up  significant growth areas for us - over many years and across our entire  technology portfolio.”
