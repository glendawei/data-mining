Showa Denko’s 8-inch SiC wafer development project funded by NEDO Tokyo-based wafer manufacturer Showa Denko K.K. (SDK) says that its ‘Project to Develop SiC Wafers Technology for Next-generation  Green Power Semiconductors’ has been  selected by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial  Technology Development Organization (NEDO) as an R&D target of  ‘Next-generation Digital Infrastructure  Construction’ as part of its Green Innovation Fund projects. In October 2020, the Japanese Government declared  that it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Aiming to significantly  accelerate efforts toward structural changes in the energy and industrial  sectors and to make corresponding investments in innovation, the Ministry of  Energy, Trade and Industry (METI) decided to develop a 2 trillion yen Green Innovation Fund as part  of NEDO. SDK’s business manufacturing SiC epitaxial wafers  for power semiconductors is claimed to have the top share of the global SiC epiwafer market. In the project, SDK plans  to use its intellectual property portfolio and  development expertise to develop SiC epiwafers with a diameter of 8-inches, and to reduce the  defect density by at least one order of magnitude, hence reducing production  costs for next-generation power semiconductors. During the project’s implementation period of  nine years (from fiscal 2022  to fiscal 2030), SDK aims to develop technology to accelerate the growth rate  of SiC bulk single crystal in cooperation  with Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology  (AIST).
