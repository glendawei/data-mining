University of Glasgow appoints research associate to lead KTP with Vector Photonics Scotland’s University of Glasgow has appointed Adam McKenzie as a  research associate leading its  Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP)  project with Glasgow-based photonic-crystal  surface-emitting laser (PCSEL) firm Vector Photonics Ltd. McKenzie will  analyse PCSEL reliability and failure capabilities to inform new product  development and accelerate commercialization. A robust accelerated life-test  (ALT) ‘burn-in’ system for PCSELs will be developed and the University of  Glasgow’s Kelvin Nano-characterisation Centre (KNC) will provide the facilities  for failure mode analysis.

His expertise extends to InP-based overgrowth processes  and the development of InGaAsP and AlGaInAs epitaxy.” McKenzie is finalizing his PhD thesis ‘MOVPE Growth for GaAs-Based  PCSELs’, which has given him extensive industrial-based design and  characterization knowledge of PCSEL structures and epitaxial regrowth  processes. Undertaken while at Sivers Photonics, his research was funded by an  Industrial Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 and  resulted in a research prize from the IET (Institution  of Engineering and Technology).
