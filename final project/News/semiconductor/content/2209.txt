TRUMPF introduces 760nm and 763nm VCSELs for spectroscopic oxygen sensing TRUMPF Photonic Components GmbH of Ulm,  Germany (part of the TRUMPF Group) – which manufactures vertical-cavity  surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and photodiodes for the consumer electronics,  datacoms, industrial sensing, heating and automotive markets – is  introducing its next generation of VCSEL for spectroscopic oxygen sensing. Spectroscopic sensing solutions can  be claimed as the highest-performing sensing technique to monitor relevant  parameters such as oxygen concentration, the firm says. The new generation of  760nm and 763nm VCSELs in TO packages even increase performance reliability,  enabled by TRUMPF’s new production and processing platform. The benefit of offering solutions  at wavelengths of 760nm and 763nm is that there are no influences from  background gases, as no gas other than oxygen shows high absorption at these  emission wavelengths. “We provide integrated, smart VCSEL  solutions for easy integration of the components into demanding production  systems,” says VP marketing & sales Ralph Gudde. “TRUMPF not only  contributes its laser-source know-how, but also combines it with application,  optics and assembly know-how,” he adds.
