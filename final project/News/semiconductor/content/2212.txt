DoD awards GlobalFoundries $117m to transfer 45nm SOI from East Fishkill to fab in Malta, NY As part of the USA’s effort to sustain the  microelectronics manufacturing capability necessary for national and economic  security, and in support of Executive Order 14017 ‘America’s Supply Chains’, the Department of Defense  (DoD) has awarded $117m under Defense Production Act Title III  to GlobalFoundries (GF) of Malta, NY, USA (which  has operations in Singapore, Germany and the USA). GF will transfer its 45nm  silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor manufacturing process from its  Fab 10 facility in East Fishkill, NY, to its Fab 8 facility in  Malta, NY. The effort is a follow-on from an $8m  award issued last year through which GF conducted initial engineering baseline  activities for the transfer. The new agreement will ensure access to 45nm SOI  semiconductors critical to DoD strategic systems. The agreement is the latest collaboration  in the long-standing partnership between the DoD and GF to provide  silicon-based semiconductors for defense aerospace applications.
