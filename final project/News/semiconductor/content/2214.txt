HG aims to continue to build on its existing strengths,  accelerating growth in its GaN business, generating continuous and stable  returns for shareholders in the long term. HG Semiconductor is principally  engaged in semiconductor product business in China, including the design,  development, manufacturing, subcontracting services and sale of LED beads, a  new generation of GaN chips, GaN components and related application products,  as well as fast-charging products. Leveraging its expertise in LED  manufacturing, HG is accelerating its R&D and expansion into GaN-related  products, targeting the integration of design, manufacturing and sales of  chips, as well as providing solutions with higher efficiency and competitive  system cost. Last November,  HG made a strategic investment in GaN  Systems Inc of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of gallium  nitride-based power switching semiconductors for power conversion and control  applications).
