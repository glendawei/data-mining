Sensitron introduces GaN half-bridge module using 350V EPC2050 eGaN FET Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA says that, by  replacing traditional silicon FETs with its 350V, EPC2050 enhancement-mode  gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistor (FET), Sensitron of Hauppauge, NY, USA – which  manufactures high-reliability power electronic components for defense,  aerospace, space and medical markets – was able  to reduce the size of its solution by 60% while also improving the module’s  already excellent junction-to-case thermal conduction. Sensitron’s  SPG025N035P1B  is a  high-power-density 350V, 20A GaN half-bridge with an integrated gate drive,  optimized for stray inductance and switching performance at 500kHz. Rated at  20A, the module can be used to control over 3kW. Sensitron’s proprietary  topside cooling technology on this ultra-small, lightweight high-power-density  package (1.10” x 0.70” x 0.14”) allows for optimal thermal performance. The  SPG025N035P1B was designed for commercial, industrial and aerospace  applications.
