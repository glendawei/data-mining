Porotech wins Innovation Zone Award - Best Prototype Category at Display Week Porotech (a spin off from the Cambridge Centre  for Gallium Nitride at the UK’s University of Cambridge that has  developed porous GaN material) has won the Innovation Zone Award -  Best Prototype Category at the Display Week 2022  event hosted by the Society for Information Display (SID) in San Jose, CA, USA (8-13 May). Focused on next-generation display applications, Porotech’s  PoroGaN technology platform enables ultra-small and efficient micro-LED chips  that can emit all colors of the visible spectrum with a single GaN material  system. The firm’s DynamicPixelTuning technology, powered by its PoroGaN  micro-display platform, was voted by the industry professionals in the  exhibition as the game-changing innovation. The technology is said to unlock  dynamic color tuning of LED chips and pixels and is set to resolve the  existing micro-LED challenges in performance and manufacturability for augmented/mixed/virtual reality (AR/MR/VR)  applications. “Winning this award signifies the deep technology work in  GaN-based semiconductor materials and structures carried out by our team at  Porotech to innovate and further develop into our micro-LED display portfolio,”  says CEO & co-founder Dr Tongtong Zhu.
