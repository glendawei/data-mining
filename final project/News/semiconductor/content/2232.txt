POET’s loss rises in Q1 as product development and introduction programs expand For first-quarter 2022, POET  Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario, Canada — a designer and developer of  the POET Optical Interposer and photonic integrated circuits (PICs)  for the data-center and telecom markets — has reported a net loss of  $5.4m ($0.15 per share), up $3.7m ($0.10 per share) last quarter and $4.1m  ($0.13 per share) a year ago. Net loss included R&D costs of $2.2m, up from  $2m last quarter and $1.3m a year ago. The firm added engineering headcount as  its product development and new product introduction efforts expanded. POET  also engaged with new suppliers, through non-recurring engineering (NRE) and  qualification programs, to ensure that the supply of required products and  services will meet the company’s standards and will be available as needed. Cash outflow from operating activities was -$3.7m, up from -$2.5m  a year ago and -$3.2m last quarter. POET says that, during the quarter, it achieved the following  milestones: “The first quarter has been an active period of sampling and  expanding customer engagement,” says chairman & CEO Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “We were able to  leverage our success at the Optical Fiber  Communication conference (OFC 2022), where we demonstrated our 200G FR4 Transmit and 400G FR4 Receive optical engines,” he adds. “POET received  significant notoriety for being the only company to showcase a chip-scale  integrated FR4 optical engine,  offering substantial size, energy efficiency  and cost benefits compared to alternative solutions based on the DR4 standard,  resulting in heightened interest from companies that we have not been engaged  with previously. We are focused on advancing our efforts to convert this  interest to customer orders in the coming quarters.”
