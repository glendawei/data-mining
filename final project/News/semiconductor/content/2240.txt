Navitas GaN ICs enable TurboPower 68W charging with new motorola edge+ GaN power integrated circuit  firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo,  CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland says that its GaNFast technology has been  selected to charge Motorola’s flagship motorola edge+ (2022) smartphone.  The TurboPower 68W (MC-681) charger has arrived in the USA as a standalone  accessory to provide fast charging on top of the battery life of the new  edge+. When used with the TurboPower 68W fast charger (sold  separately), the powerful 4800mAh battery of the new motorola edge+ can be  charged by over 50% in just 15 minutes. The TurboPower 68W is an all-in-one travel-charger option for  USB-C phones, tablets and laptops. Due to efficiencies from the GaNFast power IC,  it is notably smaller than most adapters in its power range, it is reckoned. At  only 58mm x 41mm x 28mm (66cc), the TurboPower 68W  achieves a power density of 1W/cc at a weight of just 95g for  ultra-portability. Built-in protection from power surges, extreme heat and  other dangers ensures that the smartphone or tablet remains safe while  charging. The design and manufacturing enable a 2-year limited manufacturer’s  warranty for the new charger. The TurboPower 68W (MC-681) was jointly designed and built  for Motorola by Salom, which is now selling them in the USA. “The TurboPower 68W  is our most powerful addition to the Motorola Charging line-up to date as  Navitas’ GaN technology advances keep driving TurboPower speeds higher while  maintaining compact form factors,” says Joseph Reisinger, president of  Salom America Company. Navitas’ proprietary GaN power ICs integrate GaN power (FET)  and GaN drive plus control, sensing and protection circuits in a single SMT  package. Since GaN can run 20x faster than traditional silicon, the result is  easy-to-use, high-speed, high-performance ‘digital-in, power-out’ building blocks  that deliver up to 3x faster charging in half the size and weight, and with up  to 40% energy savings compared with earlier silicon solutions.
