Navitas upgrades GaN IC power by 50% for EV, solar and data-center applications GaN power integrated circuit firm Navitas  Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland has launched the NV6169, a new high-power  650/800V-rated GaNFast power IC with GaNSense technology to address  higher-power applications such as 400-1000W 4K/8K TVs and displays,  next-generation gaming systems, 500W solar micro-inverters, 1.2kW  data-center SMPS (switched-mode power supplies), and up to 4kW/5hp motor drives. GaN runs 20x faster than traditional silicon and enables up to 3x  the power or 3x faster charging with up to 40% energy savings in just half the  size and weight. Navitasâ€™ GaNFast power ICs with GaNSense technology integrate  power, drive and control circuits with additional autonomous-protection and  loss-less current-sensing to deliver simple, small, fast and now even higher-power  performance for mobile, consumer, enterprise, eMobility and new-energy markets.
