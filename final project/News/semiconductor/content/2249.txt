IQE enters micro-LED market in partnership with Porotech Epiwafer and substrate maker IQE plc  of Cardiff, UK has announced  a strategic partnership with Porotech (a spin  off from the Cambridge Centre for Gallium Nitride at the UK’s University of  Cambridge that has developed porous GaN material). The focus of the partnership is to develop, scale and  commercialize Porotech’s unique wafer technology that achieves all three  colours (RGB) on a single 200mm or 300mm GaN-based wafer for ultra-high-density  and efficient micro-LEDs, the applications for which include augmented/mixed/virtual reality (AR/MR/VR), wearable devices, smart displays  and large-scale direct-view displays. The intention is for IQE to be Porotech’s epitaxial wafer  foundry partner, providing GaN metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)  capacity for the volume production of Porotech’s PoroGaN micro-display  technology platforms. Together, the companies aim to develop and productionize  200mm manufacturing platforms as well as 300mm wafer formats. “This partnership marks IQE’s  entrance into the micro-LED market with a unique platform,” says IQE’s CEO Americo  Lemos.  “The micro-LED market presents a significant opportunity for our business.  IQE’s proven heritage in GaN epitaxy and our industry-leading footprint in  high-volume wafer manufacturing, combined with Porotech’s PoroGaN micro-display  technology platform, will create a compelling and differentiated product  offering,” he believes. “IQE’s deep heritage and  innovation in MOCVD epitaxial growth technologies, as well as its  mass-production capability, are optimized for very small high-brightness  micro-LED pixels that match perfectly with Porotech’s platform,” comments Porotech’s CEO  & co-founder Dr Tongtong Zhu.
