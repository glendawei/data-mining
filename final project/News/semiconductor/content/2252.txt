Rhombus using Wolfspeed’s 1200V SiC MOSFETs for faster EV charging infrastructure Electric vehicle  (EV) charging and power conversion system provider Rhombus Energy Solutions  of San Diego, CA, USA says that its EV2flex line of charging  infrastructure products is to be supplied  with silicon carbide MOSFETs made by Wolfspeed Inc of Durham, NC, USA, enabling greater  efficiency, higher power density and faster charging times.  Specifically, Wolfspeed’s 1200V SiC MOSFETs will power the EV2flex-120. Rhombus’  EV2flex infrastructure includes a family of products that enables fast,  bi-directional charging and efficient energy storage. Vehicle-to-grid  (V2G) charging supports power flow between the grid and the car, allowing a  charged vehicle to become a power source when needed and ultimately enhancing  the stability of the power grid. “Wolfspeed has  unequivocally demonstrated the high value of their silicon carbide MOSFETs,  and we are pleased to partner on advanced technology products,” comments Deanne  Davidson, senior VP & general manager of Rhombus Energy Solutions.  “Wolfspeed’s silicon carbide MOSFETs are a critical component for Rhombus  to meet the demands in the growing DC fast-charging market for EVs,” she adds. “Bi-directional  charging is a game-changing technology for the stability of the power grid, and  our silicon carbide solutions will help accelerate that transformation,” believes  Jay Cameron, senior VP general manager of Wolfspeed Power.  “Silicon carbide increases both power system efficiency and power  density to create a faster, more reliable transfer of power.” Rhombus’  latest product in the EV2flex portfolio; the EV2flex-120 dual channel, is  on display at the 2022 Advanced Clean  Transportation (ACT) Expo in Long Beach, CA, USA (9-11 May).
