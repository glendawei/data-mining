NeoPhotonics Q1 revenue grows 47% year-on-year, despite chip supply chain shortages For first-quarter of  2022, NeoPhotonics Corp of San Jose, CA, USA  – a vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of silicon photonics  and hybrid photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based lasers, modules  and subsystems for high-speed communications – has reported revenue of $89.3m, up  11% on $80.6m last quarter and up 47% on $60.9m a year ago due to more than 70%  growth in 400G-and-above capable products to $54m (61% of total revenue up from 56%  last quarter and 52% a year ago). This is despite the impacts of semiconductor  chip shortages. Supply chain shortages negatively impacted  revenue by about $10m, but these were primarily shortages of analog and power  semiconductors. “Our business remains  on a strong growth path,” says chairman & CEO Tim Jenks. “We are now  shipping production 400ZR coherent DCO module products to leading customers,  and we have extended our product reach to higher speeds and to new  applications, such as communications in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites,” he  adds. Product milestone achieved during the quarter include: On a non-GAAP basis,  gross margin has risen further, from 22.4% a year ago and 26.6% last quarter to  31.2%, as the first-quarter increase in under-utilization charges (per normal  seasonal patterns) was more than offset by the improved product mix and lower purchase price variance. Operating expenses  have risen further, from $21.5m a year ago and $23.3m last quarter to $25m, due  to higher research & development (R&D) and general & administrative  (G&A) expenses. However, as a proportion of revenue, this is a cut from 35.3%  a year ago and 28.9% last quarter to 28%. Operating income was  $2.8m (operating margin of 3.1% of revenue), compared with losses of $1.8m (-2.2%  margin) last quarter and $7.8m (-12.9% margin) a year ago. Net income was $2.3m  ($0.04 per share), compared with losses of $3.4m ($0.06 per share) last quarter  and $7.5m a year ago ($0.15 per share) a year ago. During the quarter,  cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash rose by about  $1m to $107m. “Our 47% year on year  revenue growth, non-GAAP operating profit and significant growth from western  customers reflects our success in pivoting our business,” says Jenks. “We have  overcome the loss of the majority of our revenue from our prior largest  customer [Huawei] due to Department of Commerce restrictions, with growth from  leading customers in high-growth markets,” he adds. “The Lumentum  transaction, announced last November, remains on track, having been approved by  our shareholders and received antitrust clearance from US regulators. Lumentum  is an ideal partner to serve our customers on a larger scale and we look  forward to securing regulatory approval in China and closing the transaction,” continues  Jenks. “Looking forward,  while we continue to see strong demand for our products, we also expect  continuing challenges with IC chip supply shortages, which could materially  impact our results near term,” cautions Jenks.
