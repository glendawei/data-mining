UV-C LEDs with external quantum efficiency up to 8% Researchers in Japan have used  ‘face-to-face’ annealed (FFA) sputtered AlN (Sp-AlN) templates on sapphire to  fabricate 263nm ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with  state-of-the-art external quantum efficiency (EQE) [Kenjiro  Uesugi et al, Appl. Phys. Express, v15, p055501, 2022]. The team from Mie University, Osaka  University and University of Tokyo comments: “To the best of our knowledge, the  developed UV-C LED has the highest EQE at a wavelength of approximately 265nm,  even considering the state-of-the-art devices fabricated on sapphire substrates  and free-standing AlN substrates.” UV-C LEDs are sought to replace bulky,  fragile and hazardous mercury lamps used for sterilization and virus  inactivation, needing wavelengths shorter than 300nm. Presently, UV-C LEDs have  low EQEs of less than 10%. The reported LEDs achieved EQEs up to 8% when the  devices were suitably packaged and encapsulated.
