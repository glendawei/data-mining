K&S receives multiple orders for LUMINEX system Singapore-based Kulicke & Soffa Industries Inc  (K&S) – which designs and manufactures semiconductor,  LED and electronic assembly equipment –  has received two purchase orders, from two separate customers, for its latest  advanced display system, LUMINEX (a laser-based mini- and micro-LED  die-transfer solution launched last November). The system is capable of single die transfer, multi-die transfer  and mass transfer supporting sorting, mixing, re-pitching and placement  process steps. The broad flexibility addresses the growing advanced display  value chain and supports the needs of LED, OSAT, panel and display suppliers.

K&S says that mini-LED backlit displays represent only 3% of display  capacity currently but will accelerate to 20% penetration levels by 2025.  During this same period, mini LED direct-emissive technologies are set to grow  to 18% by 2025, creating strong growth prospects for the firm’s growing  portfolio of advanced display solutions. “Adoption continues to accelerate, and we continue to support  several active customer engagements across the advanced display value chain,”  says Nelson Wong, senior VP of global sales  and supply chain. “We are also positioned well to enable growth in the  micro-LED market with an ongoing customer engagement.” According to market analyst firm TrendForce, 4.7 million 4” mini-LED  wafer equivalents will be deployed in backlighting applications in 2026. In  parallel, about 4.6 million 4” mini-LED wafer equivalents will be  deployed in direct-emissive displays by 2026. K&S also expects that, over the coming years, micro-LEDs will enable  next-generation premium direct-emissive displays, further accelerating  long-term prospects within its advanced display portfolio.
