QPT launches qGaNDrive module Quantum Power Transformation (QPT) of Cambridge, UK  has launched its qGaNDrive module, which utilizes gallium ;nitride  (GaN) power ;transistors, for motor ;drives in HVAC (heating,  ventilation and air ;conditioning) systems. “GaN transistors have always promised the best performance and  efficiency over silicon MOSFETs and silicon ;carbide, but they are  notoriously difficult to drive at speed,” notes founder Rob Gwynne. “We have  developed an entirely new and unique topology for driving GaN transistors  allowing them to switch at speeds of up to 20MHz, delivering major benefits in  power consumption and efficiency,” he claims. “Electric ;motor ;driven systems (EMDS) consume 45% of the  world’s energy, and yet their efficiency at typical operating speeds can be as  low as 50%,” says business ;development manager Richard Ord. “Our solution tackles performance across  the range of operating speeds and could improve efficiency by up to 35%,” he  reckons. The challenge of driving GaN transistors has so far restricted  broader adoption and compromised performance. QPT claims that its solution  fixes that problem and will accelerate GaN market share. The qGaNDrive module integrates its core topology with GaN  transistors in a fully EMC-screened turn-key power module. The firm estimates  that a typical 15kW domestic heat ;pump could deliver a return in energy ;savings  in 100 ;days or less. QPT is attending Power, Control and  Intelligent Motion (PCIM) Europe 2022 in Nuremberg, Germany (10-12 May).
