Porotech demonstrating tunable-colour DynamicPixelTuning technology At the Society for Information  Display (SID) Display Week 2022 event at the  San Jose  Convention Center, CA, USA (10-12 May), Porotech (a spin off from the Cambridge Centre  for Gallium Nitride at the UK’s University of Cambridge that has developed  porous GaN material) is unveiling DynamicPixelTuning on its PoroGaN  micro-display platform. This makes it possible to create full-color or  tunable-colour displays using identical pixels from a single wafer – achieving  color uniformity while eliminating complex fabrication processes. The firm reckons that the  development can accelerate the commercialization of micro-LEDs, mini-LEDs and  LEDs to deliver display products for augmented/mixed/virtual reality (AR/MR/VR)  applications, smart wearable devices, smart displays and large-scale  direct-view displays. Porotech claims to be first to  unlock dynamic color tuning of LED chips and pixels, with its PoroGaN platform  making it possible for each individual LED on an epiwafer to emit all colors of  the visible spectrum. 
        At this stage, the Porotech  proof-of-concept displays are tunable mono-color, with uniform brightness and  color for display products in the micro (µm) and nano (nm) pixel space. But the  company’s proprietary PoroGaN platform and Dynamic Pixel  technology are paving the way to a monolithic full-color RGB display very soon.  Picture: Porotech’s display demonstrating its tunable-color  DynamicPixelTuning technology. The PoroGaN platform also enables a  one-step wafer-to-wafer bonding process – removing key manufacturing barriers  for full and tunable color micro-display fabrication, increasing yields and  reducing production costs and time to market. “PoroGaN’s wavelength-agnostic  optoelectronic properties also simplify electronic and optoelectronic system  design integration,” says CEO & co-founder Dr Tongtong Zhu. Micro-LED and mini-LED display  fabrication remains challenging due to the multi-phase processes currently  required to manipulate elements at the micro- and nano-scale. “With Porotech’s  porous GaN technology and scalable architectures, the PoroGaN platform  significantly simplifies the mass-transfer or pick-and-place process,” says  Zhu. “In the case of micro-displays, it  eliminates the need for transfer by allowing wafer-scale bonding of epiwafer to  backplane in a single step,” he adds. “The simplification of the process delivers  high-efficiency and high-yield solutions, leapfrogging full-color micro-LED and  mini-LED displays as viable mass-market products for next-generation display  applications.” The PoroGaN platform is configurable  to LED epiwafers for both micro-LED and mini-LED chip processing. Other  configurations include chip-on-wafer, chip-on-tape and tunable material  platforms. At Display Week,  Porotech is demonstrating its technology at stand R23 in the I-Zone section. Zhu  is also among the speakers at the event’s Business Conference  on 9 May.
