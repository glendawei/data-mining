II-VI Inc and Coherent refile Premerger Notification and Report Form Engineered materials and  optoelectronic component maker II-VI Inc of Saxonburg, PA, USA and Coherent Inc  of Santa Clara, CA (which provides lasers and laser-based technology for  scientific, commercial and industrial applications) have refiled their  Premerger Notification and Report Form (‘HSR Notification’) with the Federal  Trade Commission and the US Department of  Justice, in connection with the pending acquisition of Coherent by II-VI. The HSR Notification, which triggers a  30-day review period, was made prior to the one-year expiration of II-VI’s and  Coherent’s initial HSR Notification filed last year. The parties continue  cooperative discussions with the State Administration for Market Regulation of  China (SAMR), and the decision to refile the HSR Notification is due to the  parties’ updated view of the anticipated timing of formal approval from SAMR. Other than the foregoing, there are no  other open regulatory closing conditions to the proposed merger, and II-VI and  Coherent now expect the closing of the merger to occur prior to 30 June.
