Vector Photonics’ LIFT grant brings life testing of 3D metal printing PCSELs in-house Photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL)  firm Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK says that the LIFT grant from UK Government agency Innovate UK (which provides funding and support for business  innovation as part of UK Research and Innovation) has enabled it to  develop an in-house accelerated life testing (ALT) capability for its  high-power PCSELs. The 1030nm PCSELs are being developed for next-generation 3D metal  printing as part of the project BLOODLINE (Bright  Laser diOdes fOr aDvance metaL  addItive maNufacturing systEms), which is also funded by  Innovate UK but within the international Eureka project framework. Vector  Photonics says that its high-power PCSELs have a unique combination of  increased power, reduced cost and improved performance, enabling fast,  high-resolution, 3D metal printing with less post-production finishing. “The LIFT grant, which is for £100,000, comes from  Innovate UK’s resilience fund, helping companies recover from the impact  of COVID,” says principal development engineer Dr Calum Hill, who secured  the LIFT grant. “We have used it to fast-track the development of our own  in-house, life-test capability. By bringing this service in-house, we have  helped accelerate the commercialization of high-power PCSELs, as outsourcing  often causes delays.” The BLOODLINE project has linked Vector Photonics with Japan-based laser epitaxy manufacturer QD Laser Inc  (a spin-off from Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd)  for wafer supply; a group of leading, industrial equipment manufacturers  for product assessment; and the UK’s Compound Semiconductor Applications  (CSA) Catapult for other testing requirements.
