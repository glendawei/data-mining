LUXEON SunPlus portfolio gains high-power deep-red HPE variant LED maker Lumileds of San Jose, CA, USA has  launched the LUXEON SunPlus HPE,  a high-power, deep-red (660nm) LED designed specifically for the horticulture  lighting industry. LUXEON SunPlus HPE is claimed to achieve the highest PPF (photosynthetic photon flux) and PPE (photosynthetic photon efficiency) from its  industry-standard 3.5mm square ceramic package. The new deep-red LED is  part of the SunPlus horticulture portfolio that spans a broad range of  wavelengths and colors (including white, purple and lime) in a variety of  mid-power, high-power and CoB (chip-on-board) packages, which offers  flexibility to growers to create a specific lighting mix required for various  types of crops. “Much of the horticulture market is adopting solutions that use a  mix of white and deep-red LEDs,” says senior product marketing manager LP Liew.  “The new LUXEON SunPlus delivers top-notch performance,” he claims. “And it’s  available with extremely short lead-times… It’s the highest-performing LED and  its shipping.” The LUXEON SunPlus HPE has the robustness to stand up to harsh  horticulture environments and deliver the longevity expected of all LUXEON  LEDs, says Lumileds. “It pairs  exceptionally well with our high-efficacy LUXEON SunPlus 3030 and 5050 LEDs,  the two most commonly deployed white LEDs,” Liew continues. “This white and  deep-red horticulture combination can significantly drive down the system cost  and reduce operating costs due to the solution’s superior efficacy.” With its industry-standard package, the LUXEON SunPlus HPE has various off-the-shelf optical  solutions available to enable designers to select the right viewing angles to  achieve the appropriate intensity of light for the crops. LUXEON SunPlus is a  single portfolio engineered to address the full breadth of horticulture  lighting applications.
