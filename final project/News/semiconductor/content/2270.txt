Riber’s revenue falls 25% in Q1 due to deferred billing for major Services & Accessories order For for first-quarter 2022, Riber S.A.  of Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation  sources and effusion cells – has reported revenue of €2.4m, down 25%  on €3.2m a year ago. Of total revenue, 50% came from Europe, 39% from  Asia, and 11% from North America. Revenue came entirely from Services  & Accessories, with the temporary contraction due to deferred billing for a  major order (so revenue is expected to bounce back strongly in second-quarter  2022). While no revenues were recorded for  MBE Systems, this reflects the production cycle for machines that have been  ordered for 2022 and is not an indication of the firm’s performance over the  full year, says Riber. During Q1, Riber  recorded six orders for MBE systems, confirming the significant upturn in new  orders despite the persistent obstacles for granting export licenses for  certain contracts in Asia. The order book  hence totaled €22.8m at the end of March, up 32% from €17.3m at end-March 2021.  Specifically, the Systems order book has risen by 74% from €9.6m a year ago to  €16.7m (comprising nine systems, with eight to be delivered in 2022). The  Services & Accessories order book has fallen by 20% from €7.7m to €6.1m,  faced with a high basis for comparison. Riber is hence  forecasting growth in both revenue and profitability for 2022 compared with  2021. In addition, due to a strong pipeline of prospects for both systems and  services, Riber expects to continue to record new orders during second-quarter  2022.
