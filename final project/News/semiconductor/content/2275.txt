Kubos’ cubic GaN 20 times faster than hexagonal GaN LEDs for VLC Spun out of the University of Cambridge in 2017 –  with an exclusive license to develop and commercialize its proprietary  cubic-phase gallium nitride (GaN) intellectual property – Kubos  Semiconductors Ltd of Cambridge, UK,  in collaboration with researchers at the universities of Manchester and  Cambridge, has identified the potential for its material to deliver LEDs  capable of switching at significantly faster speeds than those produced in the  hexagonal crystal phase. Carrier lifetimes in cubic GaN quantum wells  have been measured at <0.5ns, which is more than 20 times faster than  typical c-plane hexagonal GaN LEDs (≈10ns). Along with other beneficial  properties of cubic GaN, these shorter carrier lifetimes offer the  potential to develop LEDs across the visible spectrum that can be switched at  very high speeds (>1GHz). “These measurements suggest cubic GaN LEDs could be used in  visible light communications (VLC) applications enabling higher-speed  connectivity, and we are already seeing some early commercial interest in this  area,” says technical director & founder professor David Wallis.
