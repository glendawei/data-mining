Lumileds boosts performance of LUXEON SunPlus 3030 and LUXEON 3030 HE Plus LEDs for horticulture and illumination LED  maker Lumileds of San Jose, CA, USA has announced a new, higher performance level consisting of 21 new parts for its horticulture and  illumination mid-power 3030 LEDs.  Typical flux, PPF (photosynthetic photon flux)  and efficacy have increased by 2%. In a luminaire consisting of hundreds of  LEDs this is important and, implemented throughout a greenhouse or in a  vertical farm for example, it can have a tremendously positive impact on cost  and energy use, says Lumileds. The  new parts have correlated  color temperatures (CCTs) of 2200-6500K and color rendering indexes (CRIs) of 70, 80 and 90. LUXEON  SunPlus 3030 (previously known as  LUXEON 3030 HE Plus for Horticulture) is specified for  PPF and PPE (photosynthetic photon efficiency)  for horticulture while the LUXEON 3030 HE Plus is specified in flux and efficacy  for illumination.
