Vector Photonics’ lasers on schedule with project BLOODLINE In advance of the LASER World of PHOTONICS  2022 trade fair in Munich, Germany (26-29 April), photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL) firm  Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK says that the  project BLOODLINE (Bright Laser diOdes fOr  aDvance metaL addItive maNufacturing systEms) is on schedule. Funded by UK Government agency Innovate UK  (which provides funding and support for business innovation as part of UK  Research and Innovation) and led  by Vector Photonics, the £1.5m BLOODLINE project  is developing high-power 1030nm PCSELs for next-generation 3D metal printing. The project is guided by the Eureka Network international  development program, in conjunction with Innovate UK’s Japanese counterpart,  the Japan National Research and Development Agency’s New Energy and Industrial  Technology Development Organization (NEDO). Japan-based laser epitaxy manufacturer QD Laser Inc  (a spin-off from Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd) has partnered Vector  Photonics for wafer supply. A group of industrial equipment manufacturers will  provide product assessment. The UK’s Compound Semiconductor  Applications (CSA) Catapult will provide independent accelerated life testing (ALT). “Vector Photonics’ high-power PCSELs are set to revolutionize the  3D metal printing industry,” reckons  Vector’s chief technology officer Dr Richard Taylor. “They significantly  increase printer performance and could well accelerate market growth, which is  already set to quadruple to $10bn by 2025 [according to the report ‘Additive  Manufacturing with Metal Powders,  2019’ from SmarTech Analysis],” he adds. “The PCSELs have a unique combination  of increased power; reduced cost and improved performance – the result of  higher resolution and faster printing, along with reduced finishing overheads.”
