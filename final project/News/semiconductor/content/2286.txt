EPC showcasing GaN for power delivery and advanced autonomy at PCIM Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes  enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power field-effect transistors  (FETs) and integrated circuits for power management applications – is  delivering multiple technical  presentations on GaN technology and applications at PCIM Europe 2022 in Nuremburg (10–12 May). In addition,  in Hall 9, Stand 113, the firm is demonstrating its latest  eGaN FETs and ICs  in a large variety of customer end products. 48V automotive systems  boost fuel efficiency by ~10-15% (delivering 4x the power without increasing  engine size) and reduce carbon dioxide  emissions by 25%. EPC will demonstrate how GaN enables 2kW bidirectional  converters that increase efficiency, shrink the size, and reduce system costs  for the next generation of mild hybrid and electric vehicles. Autonomous  vehicles create new possibilities for mobility, safety and efficiency. eGaN  FETs and ICs provide the short pulse widths  needed for higher-resolution light detection & ranging (LiDAR) that enable  autonomy, and the higher pulse current  to extend the range of LiDAR systems. LiDAR systems with GaN can see further,  faster and better. EPC’s booth is exhibiting multiple GaN-based solutions for  both short- and long-range LiDAR applications. GaN-based motor drives allow  various applications such as warehouse autonomous robots, eMobility and drones  to reduce size and weight, extend range and increase reliability. At PCIM, EPC  will have examples of GaN-based motors capable of driving everything from  ebikes to city cars. EPC’s GaN  experts will be available to discuss the latest progress and roadmaps for GaN integration.  Visitors can work live with the web-based design tools available in the GaN Power Bench to accelerate  their design cycles. EPC is giving the following technical presentations featuring GaN  FETs and ICs: 10 May 11 May 12 May
