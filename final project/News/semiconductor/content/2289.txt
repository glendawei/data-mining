Lumentum exhibiting at LASER World of PHOTONICS In  Stand #330 (Hall A6) at the LASER World of PHOTONICS 2022  trade fair in Messe Munchen, Munich, Germany (26-29 April), Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose,  CA, USA (which designs and makes photonics products for optical networks and  lasers for industrial and consumer markets) is showcasing demonstrations  with partners as well as its latest laser solutions for industrial and 3D sensing  markets. The latest  additions to the firm’s portfolio include the M Series of high-performance  multi-junction vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays for  automotive and industrial 3D sensing applications (announced in early  April). Specifically,  Lumentum is displaying a range of VCSEL-based illumination solutions and  partnership demonstrations for intelligent 3D sensing consumer, automotive  and industrial applications, including mobile, access control, industrial  Internet of Things (IoT), extended reality and autonomous  driving. Lumentum’s  automotive-qualified M Series includes high-performance multi-junction  VCSEL arrays for short- to long-range mobility and industrial light detection  and ranging (LiDAR) applications. The M Series, which includes the  M51-100, is easily integrated into customer platforms and can replace  edge-emitting lasers in existing mechanically scanned systems or be arrayed  into configurable illumination sources for addressable, solid-state electronic  scanning LiDAR systems, says the firm. In addition,  Lumentum’s portfolio of next-generation 3D sensing-enabling VCSEL  solutions, including its 10W flood illuminator module, is being featured  in partnership displays at the Lumentum stand.
