Speedy, durable, retentive GaN non-volatile memory Hong Kong University of Science and  Technology (HKUST) reports on a gallium nitride (GaN) non-volatile memory (NVM) with good speed, retention  and endurance at the same time [Tao  Chen et al, IEEE Electron Device Letters, published online 21 March 2022].  In silicon-based NVMs there tends to be a trade-off in these characteristics,  creating a manufacturing ‘trilemma’ due to the use of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling  across a tunnel oxide (TO) to change the memory  state. The researchers comment: “This work shows  that the mainstream GaN-on-Si platform can also accommodate high-performance  non-volatile memory devices in addition to the  power and radio frequency (RF) devices, to  enable highly intelligent electronic systems.”
