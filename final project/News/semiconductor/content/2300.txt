Lumileds launches LUXEON HL2Z un-domed CSP high-power LED Lumileds LLC of San Jose, CA, USA has introduced the LUXEON HL2Z, an  un-domed, CSP (chip-scale package), single-sided, high-power LED that is said  to significantly reduce system costs  while delivering high flux density,  high luminance and precise beam control.  It delivers luminous flux of more than 315 lumens  and efficacy of more than 160 lumens per Watt  from a compact 2.3mm-square package that is just 0.36mm high. Adopters of the new package include M3 Innovation, whose MAKO  Sports Lighting Solution uses the  LUXEON HL2Z to deliver 150,000 lumens  from each of its modules designed to illuminate athletic fields, parks, stadium  fields, and other outdoor facilities. “With LUXEON HL2Z we were able to  completely re-think what can be achieved in a sports lighting solution,” says  M3 Innovation’s executive officer Joe Casper. “The power, optical  control, and design possibilities are what made the MAKO disruptive in the  market,” he adds. “Customers that are engineering street lights, stadium lights and  other high-luminance directional applications benefit from an un-domed source  as it makes it easier to increase optical efficiency and to realize narrow beam angles and complex light distributions,”  says product manager Alvin Yeoh.  “With LUXEON HL2Z, everything from array configuration design to DLC  qualification is simplified and system costs can be lower by 20% or more,” he  claims. In addition to the available LM80 data, ray-set data and visual  inspection prove the quality of LUXEON HL2Z’s color consistency across the  beam, enabling it to support high-quality illumination indoors or outdoors.
