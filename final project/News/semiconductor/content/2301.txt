Seoul Viosys obtains permanent injunction against home electronics retailer Namsung America Ultraviolet LED product maker  Seoul Viosys Co Ltd (SVC, a subsidiary of South Korean LED  maker Seoul Semiconductor Co Ltd) says that the United States District Court for the  Middle District of Florida issued a permanent injunction against Namsung  America Inc, which sold home electronics incorporating UV LEDs  manufactured and supplied by SL Vionics Co Ltd (previously  Semicon Light). SVC says that, prior to the lawsuit, Namsung ignored its repeated  notices of patent infringement. Since 2020, SVC has been requesting that  companies stop selling SL Vionics’ LED products. The firm believes that SL Vionics’  LED products infringe its proprietary Violeds technology, which SVC invented  and has been utilizing to produce its UV LED products. When Namsung  continued selling products after notice, SVC filed the lawsuit, which asserted  infringement of 11 patents. The court’s permanent injunction order applies to any colorable  variations of the infringing products, as well as any parties who are in active  concert or participation with making or selling such products. “There are companies that seek to increase their profits by using  other companies’ patented technology,” says SVC’s CEO Young-joo Lee. “It seeks  to cheat inventors everywhere who have invested and believed in their ideas.” SVC says that, to protect its technology and promote a fair  marketplace, it actively pursues enforcement against suspected infringing UV LED  products worldwide. As an example, it recently instigated a search and seizure  of suspected infringing products against FNAC Darty Group, a large European retailer,  and subsequently filed a patent infringement lawsuit in France. SVC also filed  a patent infringement lawsuit against a European distribution company in the  Netherlands, seeking a preliminary injunction against its UV LED products.
