Vector Photonics’ CTO completes RAE’s Shott Scale Up Accelerator program for technology entrepreneurs Photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL)  firm Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK says that its chief technology officer Dr Richard Taylor has completed the Royal Academy  of Engineering’s Shott Scale Up  Accelerator program. As an entrepreneur, Ian Shott CBE FREng helped to establish the  RAE’s Enterprise Hub in 2013 to give  entrepreneurial engineers the skills to scale up their businesses and succeed. Managed by the Enterprise Hub,  the Shott Scale Up Accelerator program  seeks to equip young, engineering-based leaders and founders of high-growth UK  technology companies with the skills they need for growth. Applicants compete  for places on the program. The winners receive a £10,000 grant towards  training, expert business mentoring and coaching – all aimed at developing a  leadership mindset, strategic capability, and business-growth skills. “Managing the effective scaling of a technology company is as  critical to its success as having the original idea. Many businesses struggle  or fail at this point,” says Taylor. “The RAE’s Shott Scale Up Accelerator program has given me the  skills I need to help grow Vector Photonics, alongside the other directors. I  used the £10,000 training grant for the IoD (Institute of Directors)  Certificate in Company Direction,  covering the role of a board director, finance for non-FDs, strategy, and  leadership,” he adds. “I have also become part of a community of talented and  proven engineers and innovators, including Enterprise Hub members and Fellows of the Academy. Not only do they  have a wealth of business experience, but they also offer support and willingly  share their invaluable expertise.”
