EPC launches 100V, 58mΩ AEC-qualified ToF LiDAR IC Efficient  Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes  enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power  field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for power  management applications – has  introduced the EPC2221, a common-source dual gallium nitride FET rated at 100V, 58mΩ and 20A  pulsed current that can be used in time-of-flight (ToF) light detection & ranging (LiDAR)  systems for robots, surveillance systems, drones, autonomous cars, and vacuum cleaners. The low inductance and capacitance of the  EPC2221 allow fast switching (100MHz) and narrow pulse widths (2ns) for high resolution and high efficiency.  Additionally, the ultra-small size of 1.35mm x 1.35mm reduces PCB cost and total solution size. As  the latest addition to a growing family of GaN transistors and integrated circuits designed to meet the performance  and reliability standards of demanding automotive applications,  the EPC2221 has completed rigorous automotive AEC Q101  qualification testing including humidity testing with bias (H3TRB),  high-temperature reverse bias (HTRB),  high-temperature gate bias (HTGB)  and temperature cycling (TC), as well as several other tests. In addition to LiDAR in demanding  automotive applications, the EPC2221 is suitable for high-frequency DC-DC  conversion, wireless power applications, and synchronous rectification. “This new  AEC-certified product is the latest addition to a growing family of EPC gallium nitride-based transistors and integrated circuits designed to enable autonomous  driving and improve safety,” says CEO & co-founder Alex Lidow. “This new  integrated circuit improves the  performance while reducing size and cost for time-of-flight LiDAR systems.” The EPC2221 is priced at $1.26 for a 2.5Ku reel and available  for immediate delivery from distributor Digi-Key Electronics Corp.
