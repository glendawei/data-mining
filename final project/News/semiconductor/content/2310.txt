Laserline showcasing first blue diode laser with 3kW CW output In Hall A5 (Booth 305) at the Laser World  of Photonics 2022 in Munich (26-29 April), Laserline GmbH of Mülheim-Kärlich, Germany, which manufactures diode lasers for industrial material  processing, is presenting what it claims is the first blue diode laser with 3kW CW output power.  Designed especially for welding, cladding and additive manufacturing of copper  components, the laser is a further milestone in the power development of blue  high-power diode lasers. The second key topic being exhibited is  the new high-power-cladding solution based on a 45kW infrared (IR) diode laser,  developed in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam  Technology (IWS) in Dresden to optimize the industrial cladding of components  that are subject to wear and corrosion. Back in 2019, Laserline had already  presented the first blue CW diode laser with 1kW CW output power, whose  power was subsequently raised to 2kW just a year later. The blue 3kW  diode laser being showcased now exhibits what is said to be the highest  performance class of industrial lasers in the blue wavelength spectrum to date. In line with the 1kW and 2kW Laserline  diode lasers, the new laser operates at a wavelength of around 445nm.  Compared with infrared radiation, this spectral range is absorbed much better  by non-ferrous metals such as copper and gold. Among other benefits, this  allows the heat conduction welding of copper components close to the  surface, along with more energy-efficient and climate-friendly processes.
