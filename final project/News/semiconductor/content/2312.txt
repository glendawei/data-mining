High-Al-content p-AlGaN with 17.5meV activation energy Peking University in China has improved the  p-type behavior of high-aluminium-content aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN)  superlattices (SLs) and used the technique to improve the light output power  and efficiency of 280nm-wavelength deep ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [Jiaming Wang et al, Light: Science & Applications v11,  p71, 2022]. The researchers comment: “It is expected  that this study provides a solution for p-doping in Al-rich AlGaN, and it sheds  light on solving the doping asymmetry issue in general for wide-gap semiconductors,  especially for ternary and quaternary compound semiconductors.” Normally p-type AlGaN has extermely low  hole concentration and hole  mobility due to the very high activation energy. This makes it difficult to create effective LEDs with holes combining  with electrons from high-electron-concentration n-type AlGaN to produce  photons. Asymmetry of doping ease is common in wide-bandgap semiconductors:  n-type doping is much easier than p-type in III-nitrides and zinc oxide, while the reverse is the case for diamond (carbon).
