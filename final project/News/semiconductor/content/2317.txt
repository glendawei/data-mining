Emcore awarded Medallion 8100 L-EML transmitter contract extension Emcore Corp of Alhambra, CA, USA –  which provides mixed-signal products for the aerospace & defense,  communications and sensing markets – has  been awarded a contract extension for Medallion 8100 Series linear externally modulated laser (L-EML) CATV transmitters by a major broadband  multi-service operator (MSO) in Europe. The contract extension brings the value  of L-EML transmitters shipped for this multi-year project to over $2m. For this  phase of the project, Emcore expects to  deliver transmitters beginning in second-quarter 2022. Emcore’s L-EML transmitter technology was launched at the ANGACOM 2016  Exhibition & Congress for Broadband, Cable and Satellite in Cologne,  Germany and entered volume production in 2017. The Medallion 8100 Series  L-EML rack-mount transmitters being shipped for this project feature the  proprietary optical device L-EML technology, consisting of a high-power,  low-noise, narrow-linewidth laser combined with a highly linearized modulator  in a monolithic assembly that enables long-distance optical link  performance far exceeding that of distributed feedback (DFB) laser-based  systems. “This contract extension is a testament to the continuing success  of our L-EML transmitters and we are extremely pleased to support this MSO’s  network expansion project in Europe,” says senior product line director Grant  Olecko. “We look forward to furthering our ongoing business relationship with  future expansion projects with this customer,” he adds. Emcore is showcasing its linear fiber-optic transmission solutions for  high-speed broadband at ANGACOM 2022 (10-12 May) with its partner EQ  Photonics GmbH at the Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany (Hall 7,  booth #B20).
