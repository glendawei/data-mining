Riber’s revenue up 3% in 2021, driven by diversification of product mix For full-year 2021, Riber S.A. of  Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems  as well as evaporation sources and effusion cells – has reported  revenue of €31.2m, up 3% on 2020’s €30.2m. MBE system sales  were €17.4m, down 4% on 2020’s €18.2m (with eight machines delivered, versus 10  in 2020). However, this followed the rejection by the French authorities of export  licenses worth €9m in 2021. Services &  Accessories revenue maintained its strong growth, rising by 15% from €12m to a  record €13.8m (44.2% of total revenue). Due to a favorable  change in the product mix and an increase in the value of the systems sold,  gross margin has risen from 30.1% to 35.4%. Operating  expenditure rose from €8.4m in 2020 to €9.8m in 2021, due to R&D investment  being increased by 80% to (€3.8m (12% of revenue). Sales & marketing costs  were cut by 4% and administrative costs by 6%. Operating income  has grown from €0.7m to a slightly  better-than-targeted €1.3m (rising from 2.3% to 4.1% of revenue). Likewise, net income rose  from just €0.3m to €1.5m (from 0.9% to 4.7% of revenue). However, this included  €0.4m of financial income and expenses, linked primarily to the revaluation in  euros of receivables denominated in US dollars. During 2021, the  cash position fell by €2.2m from €8m to €5.8m, reflecting strong growth in cash  flow from operations, an increase in working capital requirements, and the  ramping up of investments. Net debt was €2.4m  at the end of 2021. During 2021, shareholders’ equity rose by €0.8m to €19.8m,  linked to earnings for the year and the distribution of amounts drawn against  the issue premium for 2020 to shareholders. The order book has  grown by just 3% during 2021, from €14.4m to €14.8m. Specifically, following the major deliveries at the end of 2021,  orders for Services & Accessories fell by 21% from €8.7m at the end of  2000, but remained at a good level of €6.9m end-2021. Orders for MBE Systems grew by 39% from €5.7m to €7.9m  (three machines, including one production system). However, this excludes  additional orders for six systems (five research and one production) announced  during first-quarter 2022, worth a total of about €9m. Compared with 2021,  Riber is forecasting growth in both revenue and profitability for 2022. Also, due  to a strong pipeline of prospects, the firm expects to continue to record new  orders during second-quarter 2022. Riber says that,  over the longer term, in an environment supporting the emergence of a European  semiconductor industry, it is moving forward with a project for profitable  growth built around its technical and industrial know-how, as well as its  capacity for innovation. Driven by new information technologies, the firm is  rolling out a strategy focused on further strengthening its leading position in  MBE, achieving regular growth in its service activities, and maintaining a  robust level of R&D investment to expand its portfolio of technologies and  applications. At the general meeting  of shareholders on 21 June, Riber’s executive board will submit a proposal to  approve a cash payout based on reimbursing part of the issue premium for €0.05  per share (to be released for payment on 4 July).
