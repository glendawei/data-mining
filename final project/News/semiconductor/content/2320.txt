Infineon extends CoolSiC M1H technology portfolio with 1200V SiC MOSFETs Infineon Technologies AG of Munich, Germany has introduced a new CoolSiC technology:  the CoolSiC MOSFET 1200V M1H. The silicon carbide  (SiC) chip will be implemented in a widely extended portfolio using the Easy  module family, along with discrete packages using .XT interconnect technology.  The M1H chip offers high flexibility and is suitable for solar energy systems, such as inverters,  that have to meet peak demand. The chip is also suitable for applications such  as fast electric vehicle  (EV) charging,  energy storage systems and other  industrial applications. The latest advances of the CoolSiC base technology enable a  significantly larger gate operation window  that improves the on-resistance for a given die size.  Simultaneously, the larger gate operation window  provides a high robustness against driver- and layout-related voltage peaks at  the gate, without any restrictions even at higher switching frequencies. Along with the M1H chip  technology, related housings have also been adopted in technology and package  variants to enable higher power densities  and more options for design engineers to improve on application performance. The M1H will be integrated into the Easy family to further improve  the Easy 1B and 2B modules. In addition, a new product that enhances the Easy 3B module with the new 1200V CoolSiC  MOSFET will also be launched. The roll-out of new chip sizes maximizes  flexibility and ensures the broadest industrial portfolio. With the M1H chip,  the on-resistance of the modules can be significantly improved, making the  devices more reliable and efficient, says Infineon.
