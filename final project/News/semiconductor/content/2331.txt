IQE’s full-year 2021 constant-currency revenue down a less-than-expected 7% For full-year 2021, epiwafer and substrate maker IQE plc of Cardiff, UK has reported revenue of £154.1m, above the £152m  guidance but down 13.4% on 2020’s £178m. However, the firm experienced a foreign exchange (FX) headwind of about £10.6m affecting GBP revenue on a  reported basis, caused by the relative strength of Sterling versus the US dollar  (in which most of IQE’s revenues are denominated). On a constant-currency  basis, revenue was down just 7.3% at £165m (in line with November’s trading  update of £164m). Wireless revenue of £83.2m was down 11.6% on a reported basis and 5.5% on a constant-currency  basis from 2020’s £94.2m. Specifically, despite some softening of demand in the  broader smartphone supply chain in Q4/2021, revenue grew by 19% for gallium arsenide (GaAs) epiwafers, driven by 5G  penetration of the smartphone handset market and WiFi 6/6E as part of a multi-year replacement cycle driven by a macro  technological trend. This resulted in high utilization of manufacturing  capacity at IQE’s Taiwan facility, where the firm has invested in eight new and  refurbished tools - including three new Aixtron G4 metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) reactors - that are currently being commissioned to support  further growth in demand in 2022 and beyond. This was offset by a 49% decline  for gallium nitride (GaN) epiwafers used in 5G infrastructure.  After a strong performance for GaN in 2020 resulting from the initial wave of  5G massive MIMO  (multiple-input, multiple-output) base-station deployments (particularly  in Asia), delays to further global deployments were experienced in 2021  (including a slow rate of deployments in Western markets). However, a multi-year  replacement cycle is still anticipated for 5G infrastructure, including strong  anticipated GaN content. Despite the decline in revenue, the Wireless business segment rose from 52.9% of total wafer sales in 2020 to 54% in 2021. Photonics revenue of £68.1m was down 16.6% on a reported basis and 10.4% on a constant-currency  basis from 2020’s £81.6m (falling from 45.9% to 44.2% of wafer sales). Vertical-cavity  surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) revenue for 3D sensing applications  was down by 19% as a result of smaller chip design sizes and a softening in  smartphone supply chains towards the end of 2021, in  line with seasonality and general softening in smartphone supply chains. IQE says that it maintained  strong market share in its key supply chain and remains well positioned for future product evolutions. Infrared  revenue is down 8%, due to the delay (into 2022) of certain defence aerospace  and security orders associated with large programs being re-phased (with no  loss of market share expected) as well as the slower introduction of sales of  certain new products. InP and other revenues were up by 16%, predominantly due  to strength in datacom and telecom markets as well as new growth areas of  sensing. CMOS++ revenue of £2.8m was up by 28% on 2020’s £2.2m (rising from 1.2% to  1.8% of total revenue), adding scale to IQE’s silicon epitaxy operation (important  to the integration of compound semiconductors on silicon, the firm notes). IQE is in the process  of improving its profitability through a global site optimization program and  growing margins (in the medium to long term) by achieving higher volumes and hence  economies of scale (improving production efficiency) at its strategic site locations. The  global site optimization program involves: Due to the site  closures, total restructuring-related exceptional costs of £3.68m have been  recognized (classified as selling, general & administrative expenses). Also, to focus the  business, longer-term developments such as cREO (crystalline  rare-earth oxide) filter technology and QPC (Quasi Photonic Crystal) are being de-prioritized in the short term to focus development  programs on market-driven solutions. IQE says that it will retain the  technology, capability and IP, enabling redeployment if and when appropriate commercial  opportunities arise. IQE has hence recognized (in its reported operating loss):  an exceptional intangible asset-impairment charge of £7.4m (including a  non-cash impairment charge of £4.7m related to cREO development costs and  patents); and a non-cash impairment charge of £2.7m for QPC and diffusers.  Excluding the  exceptional charges totaling £13.5m, the adjusted operating loss (on a  constant-currency basis) was £6.5m (compared with an operating profit of £5.4m  in 2020). Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) has fallen from  2020’s £30.1m to £18.7m on a reported basis. However, on a constant-currency  basis this is equivalent to £25m, an EBITDA margin of 15% (down  from 2020’s 17% due mainly to IQE’s operational gearing. Net cashflow from operations has fallen from £35.5m to £18.9m, representing  96% conversion of adjusted EBITDA. Capital expenditure on property, plant & equipment (PP&E) has  tripled from £5m in 2020 to £15.1m in 2021 (below the prior guidance of  £20-30m due to the phasing of payments for certain tool purchases into 2022), focussed on the  deployment of additional tools to meet growing wireless GaAs epiwafer demand for  5G handset and WiFi 6 products in Taiwan. This has resulted in  a net debt position (excluding lease liabilities) of £5.8m at the end of 2021  (compared with net cash of £1.9m at the end of 2020). IQE renewed a $35m revolving  credit facility with HSBC bank in December and had a cash position at the end  of 2021 of £10.8m. IQE reckons that  operations remain resilient in 2022 to the challenging macro-economic and  geopolitical backdrop. The firm adds that it continues to monitor and work to  mitigate potential headwinds in global semiconductor supply chains. Business development progress during 2021 is listed as: Technology developments during 2021 include: “As the only global outsourced epitaxy provider and a leader in our  field, IQE is uniquely placed to capitalize on major technological  trends while navigating a challenging external environment,” believes CEO Americo Lemos. “To secure this  growth, we must first build a commercial engine that is orientated to our  end markets, focussed on our customers and aligned with our technology  innovation,” he adds. “My vision is to grow IQE through multiple strategic and  long-term customer relationships. We will be developing this strategy more  fully during 2022.” IQE expects to grow  revenues by a low single-digit % in 2022 (at constant currency), with growth  weighted towards second-half 2022. At this level, IQE anticipates a similar  adjusted EBITDA margin to 2021 (at constant currency). Capital expenditure of  £10-15m is expected on PP&E and £6-8m on capitalized intangibles relating  to development costs and IT transformation. IQE says that in 2022  it aims to focus on building a platform for growth to deliver further progress  in 2023 and beyond. The firm is confident that this refreshed strategy will  enable a multi-year cycle of growth, driven by the macro trends of 5G, IoT and the Metaverse, as the global economy  and semiconductor markets recover from current risks and disruption.
