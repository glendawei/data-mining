Taiyo Nippon Sanso and RIKEN demo 226nm AlGaN-based DUV LED electroluminescence Tokyo-based Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp (TNSC) and Japan’s  Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Saitama have demonstrated aluminium gallium nitride  (AlGaN) deep ultraviolet (DUV) LED electroluminescence (EL) at a short  wavelength of 226nm using TNSC’s metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) equipment. AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet  LEDs with emission wavelengths of 220-350nm are applicable in a wide range of  fields including sterilization, disinfection and medical applications. TNSC and  RIKEN have conducted joint research for deep ultraviolet  LED epitaxial growth and device efficiency improvement. Previously, 280nm  emission wavelength was demonstrated using a TNSC SR4000HT MOCVD system in  4-inch wafer configuration. Now, EL  emission with a short wavelength of 226nm has been report using the TNSC  SR4000HT system in 3 x 2-inch wafer  configuration. Figure 1. EL emission spectrum of deep  ultraviolet LED. Figure 1 shows the EL emission spectrum at each wavelength,  shortening from 286nm, and showing that an EL emission spectrum was obtained  even at 226nm. Figure 2. Relationship between Al  composition and emission wavelength. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the aluminium composition  and each wavelength, indicating that the emission wavelength changes linearly  with respect to Al composition.
