Filtronic signs Ormic as Israel sales rep Filtronic plc of  Sedgefield and Leeds, UK — which designs and manufactures RF, microwave and  millimeter-wave (mmWave) components and subsystems — has signed a sales representative  agreement with Ormic Components Ltd  of Modi’in Technological Park,  Israel. Filtronic says that Ormic has a proven track record of selling  high-performance mission-critical equipment to the Israeli aerospace &  defence industry, as well as to other critical communication sectors including  telecommunications. Founded in 1997, Ormic is said to be a trusted source for  RF/microwave modules, including front-ends, amplifiers and transceivers. Filtronic offers amplifiers, transceivers,  waveguides and filters, and its capabilities across the entire RF spectrum (including mmWave) are  complementary to Ormic’s client base  and technology portfolio. Filtronic’s proven capability to develop  high-performance custom solutions for complex RF problems  allows Ormic to extend its homeland security  business, and will help it to further enhance its position within Israel’s  aerospace, defence and telecom industries. “Ormic’s existing client base and laser-focused approach to sales channel development will create new  opportunities for Filtronic,” believes Jerry Sanham, Filtronic’s director of  business development. “Our partnership with Filtronic provides  us access not only to key mmWave products but also to their strong capabilities  in hybrid and RF design and manufacturing,” comments Ormic’s managing director Ron Mizrahi. Filtronic is exhibiting on Stand 76 at European Microwave Week (EuMW 2021)  in London (2-7 April).
