Navitas highlighting GaN ICs for high-power markets at PCIM Europe In booth 523 (Hall 9) at Power, Control and Intelligent Motion  (PCIM) Europe 2022 in Nürnberg Messe, Nuremberg, Germany (10–12 May),  gallium nitride (GaN) power  integrated circuit firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA  and Dublin, Ireland is highlighting next-generation IC technologies and  market advancement. GaN runs up to 20x faster than legacy silicon and enables up to 3x  more power, 40% energy savings and 3x faster charging in half the size and  weight. Navitas’ GaNFast power ICs integrate GaN power and drive plus  sensing, protection and control circuits to deliver simple, small, fast and  efficient power conversion performance for mobile, consumer, enterprise, eMobility  and new energy markets. Over 145 Navitas patents are issued or pending. Navitas says that its recent announcements of 40 million  mass-production shipments with zero reported GaN-related field failures  and an industry-benchmark 20-year limited warranty have confirmed the  quality and reliability of its GaNFast ICs across multiple markets and  applications with customers including Samsung, Xiaomi, Dell, Lenovo and LG.  Application-specific GaN ICs tailored for data center, solar and  electric vehicles (EVs) were sampled in late 2021, and PCIM provides an  opportunity to update customers on efficiency, power density, quality and  reliability for these new, higher-power markets. “Europe is a key market for Navitas, which is reflected in our  growing team presence, our industry-leading focus on sustainability, and the  development of multiple GaN IC families targeting 1-20kW applications,”  says CEO & co-founder Gene Sheridan. “With recent customer announcements  from Brusa (EV), Enphase (solar) and especially Compuware (data center)  with the looming EU ‘Titanium+’ Directive 2009/125/EC, plus  application-specific design centers, we can demonstrate Navitas’ rapid  progress into these strategic, higher-power markets,” he adds.
