Filtronic introduces E-band high-power amplifiers for long-range telecoms links Filtronic plc of Sedgefield and Leeds,  UK —  which designs and manufactures RF, microwave and millimeter-wave (mmWave) components  and subsystems — has announced the availability of the extended Cerus  range of high-power E-band amplifiers designed for long-range commercial or  military telecommunications applications, including low Earth orbit  (LEO) and high-altitude platform systems (HAPS). The high-power Cerus range is now  available in 1-, 4- and 8-way amplifier versions. All the amplifiers integrate  Filtronic gallium arsenide (GaAs) high-electron-mobility transistor  (HEMT) power amplifier (PA) monolithic microwave integrated circuits  (MMICs), which are matched in performance and power-combined in waveguide to  maximize power output. The 4- and 8-way models feature an integral temperature  sensor with an analog output for accurate monitoring of thermal  characteristics, along with the option of control circuitry for functions  including gain control, mute control and alarms. 7XO5nZmw.jpg The Cerus amplifiers operate in the band  71–76GHz and 81–86GHz and offer what are claimed to be excellent saturated  power output levels up to +36dBm or higher, and 1dB gain compression point at  +31dBm. The transmit power control range is 10dB, and small-signal gain is  typically 24dB. With a typical output third-order  intermodulation product (OIP3) of +39.5dBm at +29dBm output power, the high  linearity of the amplifiers enables them to support 256QAM modulation for  high-capacity transmission. Measuring just 40mm x 40mm x 47mm and  weighing only 160g, their low SWAP (size, weight and power) makes the  amplifiers suitable for airborne and HAPS applications. Input and output connection is via WR12  waveguide, and DC connection is via a multi-pin connector. Filtronic is exhibiting on Stand 76 at  European Microwave Week (EuMW 2021) in London (2-7 April).
