Altum RF uses WIN’s latest 0.1µm GaAs pHEMT technology for amplifiers covering Q-, V- and E-bands Altum RF of Eindhoven, The Netherlands (which  designs high-performance RF to millimeter-wave solutions for commercial and  industrial applications) has announced three new gallium arsenide (GaAs) pHEMT monolithic microwave  integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifiers targeting  applications covering Q-, V- and E-bands. Using the PP10-20 GaAs pseudomorphic  high-electron-mobility transistor (pHEMT)  technology of WIN Semiconductors Corp of Taoyuan City,  Taiwan – the largest pure-play compound semiconductor wafer foundry – the compact die  amplifiers are said to achieve high gain and low noise, while simplifying  design-in for engineers by using single-gate and single-drain supplies. Highlights of the amplifiers  include: “This next-generation PP10-20 technology builds  upon the mature PP10-10 platform used in many of today’s E-band power  amplifiers deployed in wireless backhaul,” notes David Danzilio, senior VP, technology  and strategic business development  at WIN. As  a key differentiator, PP10-20 allows for a substantial increase in gain, with  the same operating voltage for power applications. “PP10-20 is a versatile  technology enabling a wide range of millimeter-wave front-end functions and  supports amplifier performance well into D-band,” he adds. “Building on our experience with WIN’s proven  0.1µm technology and with careful attention to modeling, design and simulation  workflow, we achieved first-pass success with a family of millimeter-wave  products in the newly released PP10-20 process,” says Altum RF’s CEO Greg Baker. This “supports our strategy to develop  leading-edge components for millimeter-wave applications, and we look forward  to building a broader portfolio of products to address today’s and future  market requirements,” he adds. “The first-pass success achieved by Altum RF  confirms the reproducibility and production readiness of the PP10-20 platform,”  says Danzilio.
