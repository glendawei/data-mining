IRPS ‘best paper’ award for ST/CNR-IMM work on silicon carbide power devices At the 2022 IEEE  International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS) in Dallas, TX, USA (27-31 March), a team from STMicroelectronics  and the Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems at the National  Research Council of Italy (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche – Istituto per la  Microelettronica e Microsistemi, CNR-IMM) in Catania, Italy, was recognized  with the IRPS 2021 ‘best paper’ award for ‘Correlation between MOSFETs breakdown and 4H-SiC epitaxial defects’,  which exposed newly  discovered relations between certain defects and the viability of silicon carbide (SiC) power  devices.
