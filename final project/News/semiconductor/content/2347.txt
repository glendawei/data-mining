SemiQ launches 1200V 80mΩ SiC power MOSFET modules in SOT-227 packages SemiQ  of Lake Forest, CA, USA – which designs, develops and manufactures SiC  components and 150mm SiC epiwafers for high-frequency, high-temperature and  high-efficiency power semiconductor devices – has released its second-generation silicon carbide 1200V 80mΩ power MOSFET modules  developed in industry-standard SOT-227 packages, namely the GCMS080B120S1-E1  with 1200V 10A parallel diode and the GCMX080B120S1-E1 without parallel diode.  The 1200V silicon carbide MOSFET  modules are the latest extension to the firm’s SiC MOSFET product portfolio. SemiQ’s SiC MOSFETs bring high efficiency to high-performance  applications including electric vehicles  (EVs), power supplies and data centers, and are specifically designed  and tested to operate reliably in extreme environments. The firm says that,  compared with legacy silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), its  MOSFETs switch faster with lower losses, enabling system-level benefits through  reduced size, weight and cooling requirements. “The SOT-227 package is one of the best fully isolated power semiconductors packages around,” says president  & general manager Michael  Robinson. “Combined with our SiC MOSFETs and SiC diodes, these products are  perfect for increasing efficiency in your fast charging  and inverters systems,” he adds. Samples are in stock at SemiQ and available through distributors  DigiKey, Mouser and Richardson Electronics. Also, 40mΩ and 20mΩ modules in the  SOT-227 are on the way.
