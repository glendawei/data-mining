Lumileds expands LUXEON 5050 HE LED range with higher CRI and efficacy Lumileds LLC of San Jose, CA, USA says that, in response to market demands for better  outdoor and industrial light and very high efficacy, it is expanding its LUXEON  5050 HE LEDs (launched last  November) with new 80 and 90 CRI (color-rendering index) parts while  simultaneously increasing the luminous efficacy of the parts that are available  in both 6V and 24V configurations. “When given the choice, OEMs and end-customers want higher-quality  light, inside or outside, and they want it to be as efficient as possible,”  says product line manager Mei Yi. “While others chose not to offer  complete portfolios, we believe that supporting the broad range of  applications, regional preferences and requirements for light is the correct  approach,” he adds. “Thanks to our phosphor, chip and package expertise, we are  able to provide the range, quality and robustness to support the most demanding  applications.” LUXEON 5050 HE delivers  what is claimed to be industry-leading lm/W performance in high-sulphur  environments. Its footprint compatibility makes it easy to design into existing  and new platforms, says Lumileds. In  particular, LUXEON 5050 HE is  suitable for outdoor, industrial and horticulture applications where  robustness, longevity and efficacy are the driving attribute. LUXEON 5050 HE is immediately available in versions with correlated  color temperatures (CCTs) of  2200–6500K with a color-rendering index (CRI) of 70 or 80, and CCTs of  2700–5700K with 90 CRI. The LED is  characterized for both illumination and horticulture applications with lumen  and efficacy ratings as well as photosynthetic  photon flux, PPF (μmol/s), and PPF/W (µmol/J). Production orders can be placed now for short lead-time delivery  through Lumileds’ distribution network.
