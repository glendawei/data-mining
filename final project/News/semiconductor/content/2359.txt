Odyssey demos 700V vertical GaN power FETs; targets 1200V next Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies Inc of  Ithaca, NY, USA, which is developing high-voltage power switching  components based on proprietary gallium nitride (GaN) processing  technology, says that it has  reached a technology milestone in its development of vertical GaN power  field-effect transistors (FETs). Global sustainability trends require new technologies and  approaches for power conversion in electric vehicles,  solar and wind turbines, data centers and industrial motors, notes the  firm. The trend to depart from traditional silicon-based transistors has been  underway for over a decade, as silicon can no longer meet the voltage and  conversion efficiency demanded, it adds. Gallium nitride,  deployed as lateral (or parallel) conduction  FETs, provides efficiency improvements but fails to provide the voltage rating required, Odyssey says. Silicon carbide  (SiC) provides the voltage rating but falls short on efficiency. Odyssey was founded to commercialize vertical GaN FETs, which can provide the conversion  efficiency of GaN with the higher voltage rating  of SiC.
