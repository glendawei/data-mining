NXP launches RF GaN power transistors for 32T32R active antenna systems NXP Semiconductors N.V. of Eindhoven, The Netherlands has announced a new series of RF  power discrete solutions for 32T32R active antenna systems, using its  latest proprietary gallium nitride (GaN) technology. The new series  complements NXP’s existing portfolio of discrete GaN power amplifier  solutions for 64T64R radios, covering all cellular frequency bands from 2.3GHz  to 4.0GHz. NXP now offers what is claimed to be the largest RF GaN  portfolio for massive multiple input, multiple output  (massive MIMO) 5G radios. As 5G networks continue to expand around the world, mobile network  operators are adding 32T32R radios to increase their massive MIMO coverage  beyond ultra-dense urban areas into less dense urban and suburban areas. By  combining 32 antennas instead of 64, coverage can be maintained more cost  effectively, while maintaining high-end 5G enabled by massive MIMO. NXP says that its 32T32R solutions deliver twice the power in the  same package as its 64T64R solutions, resulting in a smaller and lighter  overall 5G connectivity solution. This pin-compatibility enables network operators  to scale rapidly across frequency and power levels. “As 5G deployments continue to expand  globally, network operators need to extend their coverage while maintaining  performance,” notes Jim Norling, VP & general manager,  High Power Solutions, Radio Power, at NXP. “By offering twice the power in the same package size, NXP enables RF  engineers to create base stations  that are smaller, lighter and easier to deploy and conceal in urban and  suburban areas.” The new series of GaN discrete solutions is designed for 10W  average power at the antenna, targeting 320W radio units, with up to 58% of  drain efficiency. It includes driver and final-stage transistors and leverages  NXP’s highly linearizable RF GaN technology manufactured in the firm’s new  GaN fab in Arizona.
