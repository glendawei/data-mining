Showa Denko enters mass production of 6-inch SiC single-crystal substrates Tokyo-based wafer manufacturer  Showa Denko K.K. (SDK) has launched the mass production of 6-inch  (150mm)-diameter silicon carbide (SiC) single-crystal wafers, for processing  into SiC epitaxial wafers for power semiconductor devices as demand rises  rapidly in fields including electric vehicles (xEVs), railcars, and industrial  equipment. SDK has been considering in-house production of  SiC substrates, aiming to improve the quality of its SiC epiwafers and to  establish a stable supply chain for them. Between 2010 and 2015, SDK took  part in the project ‘Novel Semiconductor Power Electronics Project  Realizing Low Carbon Emission Society’, which was coordinated  initially by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and then (from  2011) by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization  (NEDO), as a member of the ‘Research and Development Partnership for Future  Power Electronics Technology’. Furthermore, in 2018, SDK took over the  SiC-wafer-related assets of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Group (now  Nippon Steel Group), and has since been developing technologies for the  mass production of SiC wafers. SDK says that it will continue purchasing SiC  substrates from its partners so that it can respond to rapidly growing demand  for SiC epiwafers for power semiconductors. The firm is hence diversifying  its sourcing of SiC substrates, establishing a stable supply chain for SiC  epiwafers.
