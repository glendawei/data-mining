Luminus launches Generation 4 high-density COBs with Robusto technology Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA,  USA – which designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology (SST) light  sources for illumination markets – has launched its next generation of  high-lumen-density white COB arrays featuring Robusto technology, the latest  enhancement to improve maximum operating temperature. High-lumen-density parts are used in narrow-beam applications  where center-beam candle power (CBCP) is the key metric. While this  depends on the specific beam angle and power level, the  high-lumen-density parts typically deliver at least twice the lumen density of  standard parts. Higher-temperature operation means more luminaire design  flexibility and lower potential cost with, for example, smaller, lighter heat sinks. These Generation 4 high-lumen-density parts provide stable  lumen output and color points with temperatures as high as Tc = 120⁰C. Robusto technology has the  ability to enable higher drive currents while still delivering what is  claimed to be exceptional lumen maintenance (L90>55k hrs) and  remarkably stable color points. The new line of COBs has what is said to be outstanding color quality,  high lumen intensity, and the industry’s best flux and color stability  over their operating life, all of which suits narrow-beam, high-CBCP  applications in retail and shop lighting, hospitality lighting, architectural  and specialty lighting. “The new Generation 4 high-lumen-density parts offer the  ultimate in COB flux density,” says David Davito, COB product line  director, Illumination. “This is complemented by Robusto technology, which  enables higher operating conditions while maintaining steady lumen maintenance  and color stability,” he adds. “With Robusto technology, Luminus’ high-density  COBs are able to provide customers with higher levels of CBCP, consistent color  and flux over the life of the luminaire.”
