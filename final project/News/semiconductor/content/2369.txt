Extending interband cascade laser wavelength University of Oklahoma and Sandia National  Laboratories in the USA have reported a record long wavelength for III-V  interband cascade lasers (ICLs) of more than 13μm [J. A.  Massengale et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v120, p091105, 2022].  The research team also reports improved performance of shorter ~11μm wavelength devices in continuous wave (cw)  operation. These coherent mid-infrared wavelengths find employment in  gas/chemical sensing, imaging, and industrial process control. The ICL structures were grown on indium  arsenide (InAs) substrates, using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). ICLs are  frequently grown on gallium antimonide (GaSb), spanning the 3-6μm range, operating even at  room temperature (300K). At present, GaSb structures suffer from the needed  optical cladding becoming too thick at longer wavelengths. The advanced waveguide structure for the  Oklahoma/Sandia work consisted of 1.65μm intermediate superlattice cladding and 0.83μm InAs separate-confinement  layers (SCLs).
