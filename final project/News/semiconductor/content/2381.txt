Navitas announces first 20-year warranty for GaN ICs Gallium nitride (GaN) power  integrated circuit firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA  and Dublin, Ireland has  announced a 20-year limited warranty for its GaNFast technology – 10x longer  than typical silicon, SiC or discrete GaN power semiconductors – and a critical  accelerator for GaN’s adoption in data center,  solar and electric vehicle (EV) markets,  it is reckoned. GaN runs up to 20x faster than silicon chips. Navitas’ proprietary  GaNFast power ICs integrate GaN  power field-effect transistors  (FETs) and GaN drive plus control, sensing and protection circuits. The result is said to be easy-to-use,  high-speed, high-performance ‘digital-in, power-out’ building blocks that deliver up to 3x faster  charging in half the size and weight, and with up to 40% energy savings  compared with earlier silicon solutions. Navitas says that the unprecedented 20-year limited warranty is  founded on its holistic approach to product reliability through design,  testing, characterization and certification. As a pioneer in GaN power ICs and a founding member of the  industry’s JEDEC JC-70.1 GaN standards committee, Navitas developed proprietary  high-speed production and qualification testing to set standards in GaN  reliability.
