Transphorm and TDK-Lambda add 12V and 48V modules to GaN-based 500W AC-DC power supply family Transphorm Inc  of Goleta, near Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures  gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors (FETs) for  high-voltage power conversion — says that TDK-Lambda Corp (a group company of TDK), which  makes power conversion products for  industrial and medical equipment, has expanded its GaN-based PFH500F product line. The PFH500F-12  and PFH500F-48 are the second and third modules in TDK’s series of 500W AC-DC  power supply units (PSUs), offering  12V and 48V power outputs respectively. As with their predecessor, the  GaN-based 28V PFH500F-28, these latest supplies deliver various GaN benefits to  end applications including a 6%  efficiency increase in a 13% smaller device package. Combined, these advantages  yield a 38% power density  improvement compared with the PFE500SA-12 and PFE500SA-48, TDK-Lambda’s  incumbent silicon-based 12V and 48V modules. The PFH500F series uses 72mΩ, 8x8 PQFN GaN FETs (TP65H070LDG)  from Transphorm. The high power density of these power transistors  enabled TDK to cool the GaN power supplies  via thin baseplates. In turn, TDK was able to produce a leaner, tightly  contained power module capable of  supporting a wide variety of broad industrial applications operating in harsh  environments. Such applications include commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) power supplies, custom fanless power supplies, 5G communication,  laser, digital signage/displays, and signaling. The 12V and 48V  PFH500F modules were designed by the TDK-Lambda Americas team in Dallas, TX,  USA and deploy a bridgeless totem-pole PFC (power factor  correction) configuration. While the flagship 28V GaN power supply took about three-plus years to  design, TDK’s engineering team was able to adapt its learning to produce these  latest models in a year. “TDK’s decision  to launch the PFH500F product line as a GaN line was the result of carefully  considering what our customers want and need,” says Jin He, VP of engineering  at TDK-Lambda Americas. “And, what our customers require are reliable power systems for use in rugged applications  that can’t afford to fail. By using Transphorm’s GaN, we are able to  confidently deliver that in increasingly smaller, higher-performing PSUs that  can also inspire end-system innovation.” TDK-Lambda’s  PFH500F-12 and PFH500F-48 power modules are said to deliver the following  advantages compared with the silicon-based PFE500SA-12 and PFE500SA-48: The PFH500F Series of modules is on display in  Transphorm’s booth 825 at the 37th annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics  Conference and Exposition (APEC 2022) in Houston, Texas (20-24 March).
