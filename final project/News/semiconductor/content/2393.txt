POET demos 200G FR4 Transmit and 400G FR4 Receive Optical Engines at OFC At the Optical Fiber  Conference (OFC 2022) in San Diego, CA, USA (8-10 March), POET  Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario, Canada — a designer and developer of the  POET Optical Interposer and photonic integrated circuits (PICs)  for the data-center and telecom markets — gave live demonstrations of  its recently announced 200G FR4 Transmit and 400G FR4 Receive Optical Engines. “Our live demos attracted a variety of existing and potential  customers, suppliers and business partners as the only company exhibiting  chip-scale integrated FR4 optical engines,”  notes CEO Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “FR4  is a multiplexed standard that transmits and receives up to 2km, compared to  its DR4 counterpart which supports a parallel four-lane standard limited to  500m. The number of fibers required is also a factor, with DR4 requiring eight  per module and FR4 requiring only two per module,” he adds. “We had 40-50 meetings overall and are rapidly gaining traction  with potential customers, including data-center operators, networking systems  and artificial intelligence (AI)  vendors and module companies,” says president Vivek Rajgarhia. “Some of the  more interesting partnering opportunities were with innovative device  companies, looking to utilize POET’s platform for the next generation of  optical engines for transceivers and  co-packaging applications,” he adds. “The Optical Interposer  is an integration platform that is agnostic to the material system that any  given device is built from, meaning that we can select the ‘best of breed’ for  the specific application rather than trying to do everything in silicon or any  other material. This distinctive feature of the POET Optical Interposer technology, among others,  means that we can address applications where conventional free-space optics or  traditional silicon photonics  cannot.” Also at OFC, Venkatesan gave a Technology Showcase presentation ‘Hybrid Integration Platform for  Co-Packaged Photonics Using POET’s CMOS Based  Optical Interposer’,  which can be found on the ‘Presentation and Events’ page of the firm’s Investor  Relations website.
