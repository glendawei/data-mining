POET responds to Shenzhen COVID lockdown POET Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada — a designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer and  photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the data-center and telecom  markets — has reported that,  as a response to the temporary lockdown resulting from a COVID-19 outbreak in  Shenzhen, critical development activities have been absorbed by Singapore and  other locations. “Over the past two years, we have established redundancy for  critical activities in Singapore, Shenzhen and Allentown, Pennsylvania, both to  accelerate development and to cope with COVID-19 lockdowns,” notes CEO  Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “On Sunday 13 March 2022 our operation in  Shenzhen, China was notified that it would be shut down until at least  20 March, due to a COVID-19 outbreak in that city. We promptly tasked both  Singapore and our joint venture  Super Photonics Xiamen with the task of continuing to build samples for  customers,” he adds. “Because we have been well prepared for such a  contingency, we do not believe this temporary lockdown will have any effect on  our planned delivery schedule to customers, prospective customers or business  partners.”
