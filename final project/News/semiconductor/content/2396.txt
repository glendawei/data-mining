GaN Systems powers Samsung Galaxy S22+ and Ultra fast charger GaN Systems Inc of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of  gallium nitride-based power switching semiconductors for power  conversion and control applications) says that its high-efficiency semiconductor products have been  selected to power the flagship Samsung Galaxy S22+  and Ultra smartphones, enabling the slim and powerful 45W charger to deliver on  the efficiency and fast-charging promise of GaN. The 45W charger is claimed to  set a new benchmark in power density and  efficiency. The latest-generation charger nearly doubles the power of the  previous generation while enabling super-fast charging. GaN is reckoned  to allow switching 20x faster than legacy silicon devices and 10x faster than  silicon carbide (SiC). The inherent  efficiency advantage of GaN is said to enable unrivaled form factors and  power density for customers across consumer, enterprise, industrial and  automotive markets. A common theme across all power markets is that  customers want lower-cost systems that are smaller, lighter and consume much  less power than legacy platforms. GaN System says that its reliability,  quality and product lifetime enables it to be a supplier to technology  companies like Samsung. “Samsung's  choice of our leading discrete solution for its flagship smartphone reinforces  just how inextricably linked high-end consumer devices  are with the cool efficiency and power of GaN,” claims GaN Systems’ CEO Jim Witham. “Samsung  continues the trend of leading companies designing top-of-the-line consumer  products around our unrivaled discrete offerings,” he adds.
