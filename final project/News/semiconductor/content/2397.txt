Toyoda Gosei makes record diameter GaN substrates, targeting next-gen power devices Toyoda Gosei Co Ltd of Kiyosu, Aichi Prefecture,  Japan, together with Osaka  University, says that it has succeeded in increasing the diameter of substrates  for gallium nitride (GaN) power  devices, by leveraging its expertise in GaN semiconductors such as blue LEDs  and ultraviolet (UV-C) LEDs.  The firm says that higher-quality and larger-diameter GaN  substrates are needed in the development of GaN power devices in order to achieve higher productivity and hence  cost reductions.  In a project headed by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment,  Toyoda Gosei and Osaka University  have employed a method of growing GaN crystals in a liquid metal of sodium and  gallium (the sodium flux method) to  fabricate a high-quality GaN substrate (GaN seed crystal) of record diameter of  more than 6-inches. The researchers will next conduct quality assessments for  the mass production of 6-inch  substrates, and continue to improve the quality and increase the diameter  (beyond 6-inches).
