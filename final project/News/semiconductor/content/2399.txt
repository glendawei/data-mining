NeoPhotonics’ full-year 400G-and-above product revenue up more than 70% to $148m NeoPhotonics Corp of San Jose, CA, USA – a vertically  integrated designer and manufacturer of silicon photonics and hybrid  photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based lasers, modules and  subsystems for high-speed communications – has reported full-year revenue of  $290.3m for 2021, down 22% on $371.2m in 2020 as it replaces  the revenue base of its largest customer in 2020. However, revenue from  customers other than Huawei grew by 17% year-on-year. Fourth-quarter 2021 revenue  of $80.6m was down 3.7% on $83.7m last quarter, but that reflected “operational  challenges as the full force of industry-wide IC chip supply shortages [primarily  analog and power semiconductors] impacted our top-line  revenue by more than $15m,” says chairman & CEO Tim Jenks. Also, Q4 revenue was up  18% on $68.2m a year ago, due to growth in 400G-and-above-capable products. “Our  products for 400G-and-above applications grew 9% sequentially, comprising 56%  of total revenue [and 51% for full-year 2021, after growing by more than 70% to  $148m], despite this product group being the most impacted by supply chain chip shortages,” says Jenks. During Q4/2021, NeoPhotonic announced the following product milestones: On a non-GAAP basis, full-year  gross margin fell from 31.3% in 2020 to 25.4% for 2021. Fourth-quarter gross  margin was 26.6%, down from 29.4% last quarter (although that included $2.5m,  or 3.1 percentage points, of incremental costs related to purchasing product on the spot-buy  market to help ensure supply for 2022). Also, Q4/2021 gross margin was up from  24.7% a year ago. Quarterly operating  expenses remained roughly flat over the last year at $23.3m, representing a  reduction from 34.8% to 28.9% of revenue. Full-year operating expense were roughly  flat year-on-year at $92.4m.

        Full-year 2021 saw an  operating loss of $18.6m, compared with an operating profit of $23.9m in 2020. Likewise,  Q4/2021 saw an operating loss of $1.8m, cut from $6.9m a year ago but a  set-back from a profit of $1.3m last quarter, due to lower revenue and increased  costs (both as a result of supply chain constraints). Quarterly net loss  was $3.4m ($0.06 per share) in Q4/2021, more than halving from $7.2m ($0.14 per  share) a year ago but compared with a net profit of $0.78m ($0.01 per share) last  quarter. Full-year net loss was $21.5m ($0.41 per share) for 2021, compared with  a net profit of $16.7m ($0.31 per share) in 2020. Full-year adjusted  EBITDA fell from $43.3m in 2020 to $2.9m for 2021. However, although it was  down from $6.7m in Q3/2021, quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $2.3m in Q4/2021 is an  improvement on -$4.7m a year ago. During the quarter,  cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash hence rose  by about $1m to $106m. NeoPhotonics expects the impacts of chip shortages in the  supply chain to continue for  at least the next two quarters. However: “Our business remains on a strong  growth path, as demand continues to increase and our backlog has expanded to  record levels with nearly a year of visibility,” notes Jenks. On 4 November,  NeoPhotonics said that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be  acquired by Lumentum for $16 per share in cash (a total equity value of about  $913m). “Lumentum is an ideal partner to serve our customers on a larger scale,”  believes Jenks. The transaction  remains on track, having been approved by stockholders at a special meeting on 1 February and following the expiration of the waiting period under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (as amended). The  remaining requirements for closure of the transaction are customary closing  conditions set forth in the merger agreement and approval from the State  Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) of the People’s  Republic of China. The transaction is expected to be completed in second-half  2022.
