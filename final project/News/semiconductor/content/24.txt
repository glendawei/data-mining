SIA Applauds Senate Passage of CHIPS Permitting Legislation by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—July 28, 2023—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today released the following statement from SIA President and CEO John Neuffer applauding Senate passage of the Building Chips in America Act (Kelly Amendment #985) as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The amendment will maximize the impact of the CHIPS and Science Act by streamlining federal reviews for chip manufacturing projects while keeping environmental protections in place.“Enactment of the CHIPS and Science Act was a landmark step toward reinvigorating domestic semiconductor manufacturing and innovation. Announced CHIPS projects total more than $200 billion in private investments and will create more than 40,000 jobs in the semiconductor ecosystem and support hundreds of thousands of additional jobs throughout the U.S. economy.“The Building Chips in America Act will help ensure these new facilities get up and running in an expeditious and environmentally responsible way, which will help maximize the CHIPS Act’s positive impact on America’s economic and national security. We thank the legislation’s Senate sponsors—Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), and Ted Budd (R-N.C.)—for their leadership, applaud Senate approval, and urge House and Senate negotiators to include the amendment in final NDAA passage.”# # #
