POET begins trading on Nasdaq under symbol ‘POET’ POET Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada — a designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer and  photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the data-center and telecom  markets — says that its common shares have begun trading on the Nasdaq  Capital Market under the symbol  ‘POET’ as of the market opening on 14 March. “Our trading today on the Nasdaq marks a significant milestone for  POET,” says chairman & CEO Suresh Venkatesan. “In addition to making shares  of the company available to a broader set of prospective institutional  investors, today’s listing serves to elevate POET’s overall visibility and  increase market awareness of our highly differentiated POET Optical Interposer platform,” he adds. “Together  with our continued expansion of customer engagements and product  commercialization, we believe trading on Nasdaq will further support our  growing momentum as well as maximize value for shareholders.” The firm will continue to maintain its existing listing and  trading symbol ‘PTK’ on the TSX Venture Exchange. For the avoidance of doubt,  no action is required by existing shareholders associated with the Nasdaq  listing.
