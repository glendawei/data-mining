Aixtron grows revenue 59% and orders 65% in 2021, driven by power electronics For fourth-quarter 2021,  deposition equipment maker Aixtron SE of Herzogenrath,  near Aachen, Germany has reported revenue of €180.9m (the  highest for 10 years), up 38% on €130.8m in Q3 and up 67% on €108.1m a year ago. Full-year  revenue grew 59% from €269.2m in 2020 to €429m  in 2021 (the highest since 2011), within the revised guidance range of  €400-440m (which had been raised last June far above the initial guidance of  €320-360m). On a  geographic basis, Asia fell from 73% to 70% of revenue and the Americas from  12% to 10%, while Europe rose from 15% to 20%. “Given  the constrained global supply chain and logistics, our team  did a fantastic job in achieving exception output and results,” comments CEO & president Dr Felix  Grawert. Of total revenue,  €366.5m (85%) came from equipment sales (up 64% from €223m in 2020), while  €57.6m came from spares sales (up 39.5% from €41.3m) and €4.8m from services. “Demand growth is fueled by a broad base of application segments  coming from the global mega-trends of sustainability, electrification, and  digitization,” says Grawert. “In some areas such as power electronics,  compound semiconductors are moving from being specialty and niche material  to become the workhorse in some of these segments of the semiconductor volume  market.” Of the equipment revenue of €366.5m, metal-organic  chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)/chemical vapor deposition (CVD)  equipment for making gallium nitride (GaN)- and silicon carbide (SiC)-based  power electronics devices doubled year-on-year to €139.7m, now comprising  the largest share of equipment revenue (at 38%, up from 31% last year). MOCVD equipment for making optoelectronics devices (telecoms/datacoms  and 3D sensing lasers for consumer electronics, solar, and  wireless/RF communications) grew by 87% year-on-year to €137m (37% of  equipment revenue, up from 33% last year). MOCVD equipment for making LEDs rose by 39% (although the share of  equipment revenue fell from 27% in 2020 to 23% in 2021).  Quarterly  gross margin has grown further, from 42% a year ago and 43% in  Q3/2021 to 44% in Q4, due mainly to a higher mix of better-margin products. Full-year gross margin rose from 40% in 2020 to  42.3% in 2021 (exceeding the expected 40%, due mainly to the strong  increase in the US$ exchange rate in Q4). Quarterly operating expenses rose only slightly from €21m in  Q4/2020 to €22m in Q4/2021, but full-year operating expenses rose from €73.5m  in 2020 to €82.5m in 2021, due partly to higher variable-compensation expense plus  €3.9m in one-time expenses for the restructuring and wind-down of Aixtron’s  South Korea-based organic light-emitting diode display (OLED)-focused  subsidiary APEVA. In particular, sales, general & administrative (SG&A)  expenses rose by €7.7m from €27.7m to €35.4m. In 2021, it became apparent that  the market will choose micro-LED technology for the development of  next-generation displays even faster than originally expected, says Aixtron.  APEVA’s shareholders hence decided not to invest further. Aixtron maintained its R&D spending at a high level of €56.8m  (13% of revenue) in 2021, as the lower development expenses for APEVA’s OLED  technology were largely offset by increased spending for the development and  completion of Aixtron’s next-generation MOCVD equipment (for applications  including power electronics and micro-LEDs). Also as a result of  restructuring APEVA, during 2021 Aixtron’s total staffing fell from 728 to 718,  despite strong growth in the number of employees in the core MOCVD business. The quarterly operating result (EBIT, earnings before interest and  taxes) has more than doubled year-on-year (up by 136%) from €24.5m (EBIT margin of 23% of revenue) in  Q4/2020 then €36.2m (28% margin) in Q3/2021 to €57.9m (EBIT margin of 32%) in Q4/2021. Full-year EBIT rose almost threefold (by 184%) from 2020’s €34.8m (EBIT margin of 13%) to €99m for 2021 (EBIT margin of 23.1%, exceeding the  20-22% guidance range, which had been raised last June from 18%). “The 184%  higher EBIT at 59% higher revenue in 2021 proves the strong operating leverage  effect we have on higher revenues, translating over proportionately into  bottom-line earnings,” says chief financial officer Dr Christian Danninger. Quarterly  net profit has more than doubled from €24.9m (23% of revenue) a year ago  and €31.4m in Q3/2021 (23% of revenue) to €51.9m (29% of revenue) in Q4/2021.  Full-year net profit hence grew  by 175% from €34.5m (13% of revenue) in 2020 to €94.8m (22% of revenue) for 2021. Operating cash flow  was €25.2m in Q4/2021. Full-year operating  cash flow was €66.4m (up from  just €23.3m in 2020). Capital expenditure (CapEx) was €4.3m in Q4 (making  €17.7m for full-year 2021), largely comprising investments in  next-generation MOCVD equipment for Aixtron’s laboratories. Free cash flow was hence €20.9m in Q4/2021. Full-year free cash flow was €48.7m (up  from just €14m in 2020), due mainly to the increase in net income and a near  doubling in trade receivables (from €41.3m to €81m, following the high volume  of deliveries made in Q4). Cash and cash equivalents (including  financial assets) have hence still risen further, from €309.7m at the end of  2020 and €330.7m at the end of Q3/2021 to €352.5m at the end of Q4/2021,  despite a €12m dividend payment in May. Inventories rose from just €79.1m at the end of 2020 to €120.6m at  the end of 2021 in preparation for the high number of deliveries planned in  2022. In view of the  successful 2021 results, at the annual general meeting (AGM) of  shareholders on 25 May Aixtron’s executive board and supervisory board  will propose to pay a dividend of €0.30 per share (up from €0.11 per share in  2021), a payout ratio of 35% of the firm’s net income. Quarterly  order intake has grown further, to €119.7m in Q4/2021, up 4.8% on €114.2m in  Q3/2021 and 30% on €92.2m in Q4/2020, driven mainly by GaN and SiC power electronics  applications tripling year-on-year to almost 45% of order intake. Demand for  SiC deposition equipment developed positively, particularly in Q4 (when it  comprised 15% of equipment orders, compared with GaN power comprising  about a quarter of equipment orders). In addition, there was continued strong  demand for the wireless and optical data communications sectors as well as  LED display sectors (both fine-pitch and micro-LED). Full-year order intake was hence up by 65% from 2020’s €301.4m to  €497.3m for 2021 (the highest since 2011). This exceeds the revised guidance,  which had previously been raised in June from €340-380m to €420-460m then again  in late July to 440-480m.   Equipment order backlog has hence risen by 42%  during 2021, from €150.9m to €214.6m. Based on the order  situation and the budget rate of $1.20/€ (versus $1.25/€ in 2021), Aixtron  expects double-digit growth in full-year order intake to €520-580m for 2022. Based on the equipment order backlog (convertible into 2022  revenue) of €215m as of 1 January, joined by a forecasted €170-220m in new  order intake that should be convertible into revenue during 2022, plus a  forecasted €65m in after-sales revenue, Aixtron expects double-digit growth in full-year  revenue to €450-500m in 2022. Full-year gross margin should be  about 41% and EBIT margin 21-23%  for 2022. “This guidance include our R&D spending from the completion of  the development of our next-generation products, as well as our activities that  strengthen our organization in anticipation of further growth ahead of us,”  notes Grawert.  “We had made our guidance based on the assumption that our business will not be  impacted by any global crisis or pandemic,” he adds.
