AXT grows revenue 44% year-on-year, aided by market share gains For fourth-quarter  2021, AXT Inc of Fremont, CA, USA – which makes  gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium phosphide (InP) and germanium (Ge) substrates and raw  materials – has reported revenue of $37.7m, exceeding both the initial guidance  range of $34-36m (provided on 27 October) and the increased guidance range of  $36–$37m. Despite usually being a down quarter for AXT, this is up 9% on $34.6m  last quarter and up 40% on $27m a year ago, representing an eighth consecutive quarter of growth and a fourth  consecutive quarter over $30m. Full-year 2021  revenue was $137.4m, up 44% on 2020’s $95.4m (and up by more than 65% on 2019).  InP substrate revenue grew by 41%, becoming the firm’s single largest revenue  contributor. GaAs substrate revenue grew by 38%, driven by a wide variety of  applications. Germanium substrate revenue grew by 18%. Growth is all  organic, driven by market expansion and market share gains. “We grew in  every revenue category across our portfolio without the help of price  increases,” notes chief financial officer Gary Fischer. “This  underscores the momentum we are seeing in our business, with new applications  coming to the market, major technology trends, and our own success in winning  share at strategic customers.” By product category in Q4/2021, InP was $13.1m, GaAs was $11.3m,  germanium was $4.2m. Total substrate sales were therefore $28.6m, up 9.2% on  $26.2m last quarter and up 33% on $21.5m a year ago. In addition, revenue was $9.1m from AXT’s two consolidated  raw materials joint venture companies: BoYu (which makes high-temperature  pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles and pBN-based tools for organic  light-emitting diodes) and JinMei (which supplies high-purity materials  including gallium and germanium, as well as InP poly and other materials). This  was up from $8.4m last quarter and $5.5m a year ago, after both BoYu and JinMei  relocated their factory to AXT’s campus in Kazuo in 2020 (enabling them to  expand capacity in response to continuing strong market demand), aided by a  recovery in pricing of raw materials such as raw gallium. Of total revenue in Q4, the proportion from the Asia-Pacific region  was 74.9%, Europe was 16.7% and North America was 8.4%. For the fourth consecutive quarter, no customers reached 10% of  revenue (compared with two a year ago), and the top five customers generated just  29% of total revenue (down from 37%). “Our continued revenue diversity  demonstrates that our growth is not overly dependent on one large customer or  application,” says Fischer. “This is another factor contributing to our  confidence that our growth has reached a point of sustainability and will  continue throughout 2022.” On a non-GAAP  basis, full-year gross margin grew from 31.9% in 2020 to 34.8% for 2021. However,  quarterly gross margin has fallen further, from 33.9% a year ago and 33.8% last  quarter to 32.4%. “Contributing factors were increasing raw material costs  [i.e. raw gallium that JinMei has to buy] within a constrained environment of  demand, lower yields in some of our products, and the decision to accept  strategic lower-margin business in order to position ourselves competitively in  advantageous markets and customers,” says Fischer. “These factors  offset the improvements made to gross margin at JinMei from expiring contracts  [under which it had been selling materials at a pre-set price to several  customers], as well as a new and promising raw material recycling program.” Quarterly operating expenses have risen further, from $6.6m a year  ago and $7.7m last quarter to $8.1m, driving full-year OpEx up from $23.8m in  2020 to $30.4m for 2021. R&D remains one of the primary drivers of the  increase. “We have two major programs that are ongoing: the development of  6-inch InP and the development of 8-inch GaAs,” notes Fischer. Net income was  $4.1m, down from $5.4m ($0.13 per share) last quarter (although Q3  included two local government grants totaling $1m for facilities investments in  the Kazuo region that did not repeat in Q4). Also, earnings per share of $0.09  exceeded the $0.06-0.08 guidance range. In addition, this was up on $2.8m ($0.06 per  share) a year ago. Full-year net income hence more than tripled from $5.9m  ($0.14 per share) in 2020 to $19.1m ($0.44 per share) for 2021. In Q4, depreciation and amortization was $2m. Capital expenditure  (CapEx) was $10.5m (up from $6.1m last quarter). Total stock compensation was  $1.1m. During the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and investments hence fell further,  from $56m to $51.8m. “2021 was a  pivotal year for our business. We are hitting an inflection point in which  applications that were once considered early-stage technologies are now moving  to mainstream adoption,” believes CEO Dr Morris Young. The demand environment remains strong. For Q1/2022, AXT expects  revenue to rise further to $38-40m, with net profit of $0.07-0.09 per share. In late  December, AXT’s China-based wafer manufacturing subsidiary Beijing Tongmei Xtal  Technology Co Ltd submitted its application to list its shares in an initial  public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Sci-Tech innovAtion boaRd  (STAR Market). The application was formally accepted for consideration on  10 January, and AXT has received its initial comment letter. However, the  process of going public on the STAR Market includes several periods of review  and, therefore, is a lengthy process. Tongmei expects to accomplish this goal in  second-half 2022. “With our current market drivers, we believe we can deliver  revenue growth in 2022 of 15-20% of our 2021 results,” says Young. “This is  expected to come from market expansion, share gains, and customer wins,” he adds.  “With clear applications and design-win success, we believe we will grow our  indium phosphide revenue in 2022 by 35-40%. We also believe that significant  groundwork will be laid in 2022 for new applications in gallium arsenide. We  are already seeing healthy growth in high-end LEDs, solid-state industrial  lasers, and Wi-Fi for IoT applications, which we expect will continue,” he  adds. “Recently, we have also seen demand for gallium arsenide  substrates for power amplifiers in 5G handsets. This is a new market for us and  one that is opening up to AXT as a result of both the increased demand in 5G  handsets as well as the supply constraints in our competitors to meet customer  needs. Though the gross margin profile of this application is lower than other  areas of our business, the volume opportunity is attractive, and we believe we  can drive healthy gross margin contribution in our business model in the coming  years.” “Gross margin improvement is a top priority for AXT in 2022,” says  Fischer.  “Like most businesses, we have seen a steady increase in costs relating to  everything from wages to the materials required to manufacture our products.  Those increases will likely continue to create some near-term offset in 2022.  However, we think we can get back to 35% range this year,” he adds.  “Improvement will come through growing volume, favorable product mix, better  pricing, and a strong focus on yield improvements and manufacturing  efficiencies. We will see some incremental gross margin improvements as JinMei  continues to work through some of the contracts that began creating a headwind  in Q3.” “Our  investments in capacity, R&D for larger-diameter substrates, and the STAR  Market IPO of our Tongmei subsidiary give us significant competitive advantages  in our ability to scale our business, and meet the needs of tier-1 customers  and emerging high-volume applications,” says Young. “We have a strong  foundation in place and believe that the stage is set for another year of  meaningful achievement in 2022,” he concludes.
