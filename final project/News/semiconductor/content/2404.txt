Soitec expanding SmartSiC wafer manufacturing for EVs and industrial markets Engineered substrate manufacturer Soitec has announced a new fabrication facility  at its headquarters in Bernin, near Grenoble,  France, primarily to manufacture new silicon carbide (SiC) wafers targeted at the electric vehicle (EV) and industrial markets. The  extension will also support Soitec’s 300mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI)  activities. The fab is to produce SmartSiC engineered wafers developed by  Soitec at the Substrate Innovation Center at CEA-Leti in Grenoble, using  Soitec’s proprietary SmartCut technology. Soitec notes that silicon carbide  wafers adds value for industrial applications and EVs by increasing their  driving range, shortening the charging time  and diminishing their cost. With its SmartSiC products, Soitec is engaged with  major SiC device makers and aims to generate first revenues in second-half  2023. “By 2030, around 40% of all new cars will be electric,” expects CEO  Paul Boudre. “Our unique, highly performant, sustainable and cost-competitive  SmartSiC solution addresses the industrial challenges, helps to optimize energy efficiency, and will accelerate the  adoption of electric vehicles,” he  adds. “This investment is a major milestone for us, as SmartSiC is set to be  another growth engine for Soitec and a driver of the transformation of the  automotive and industrial markets.”
