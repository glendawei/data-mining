Optimizing InGaN templates for LEDs North Carolina State University in the USA  has been investigating the potential of indium gallium nitride (InGaN) for  enhancing the performance of III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [Mostafa Abdelhamid et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v120, p081104,  2022]. The reduced strain in InGaN quantum wells  (QWs) grown on InGaN templates should increase light output, particularly for  the longer wavelengths desired in micro-LEDs and full-color displays â€“ but  there is a trade-off since such templates have higher defect densities relative  to pure GaN. For commercial use, the former effect must significantly outweigh  the latter.
        The balance arises through the strain  effects of lattice and thermal expansion mismatching between GaN and the target  InGaN. Using an intermediate InGaN template should lighten these constraints.
