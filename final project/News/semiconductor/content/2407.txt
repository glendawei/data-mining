GaN Systems showcasing power electronics solutions at APEC In booth #1324 at the 37th annual IEEE  Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC 2022) in  Houston, Texas (20-24 March), GaN Systems Inc of Ottawa,  Ontario, Canada (a fabless developer of gallium nitride-based power switching  semiconductors for power conversion and control applications) is showcasing its  lineup of power electronics solutions, including the following: To give an in-depth review of managing thermals  in high-density applications, GaN Systems will present a technical session  ‘Thermal Design Considerations for GaN-Based Power Adapters with  Multi-Heat Sources’ on 22 March (9:10–9:30am Central Time) at  Location 361ABC. “Efficient power generation, distribution and  conversion are key factors in driving sustainability and reducing emissions,  and GaN is more efficient and more cost-effective than both silicon and  silicon carbide,” says Paul Wiener, VP of strategic marketing. “The  power industry is rapidly transitioning to GaN for best-in-class efficiency,  design flexibility, costs, and more. We see rapid adoption across all of our  target markets – automotive, consumer, enterprise and industrial.”
