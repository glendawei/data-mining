EPC and Analog Devices collaborate to deliver up to 2MHz switching frequency for high-density DC-DC converters Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of  El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes enhancement-mode  gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power  field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for  power management applications – has announced the availability of the EPC9160, a dual-output  synchronous buck converter reference design board operating at 2MHz switching frequency that converts an input voltage  of 9-24V to a 3.3-5V output voltage and delivers up to 15A continuous current  for both outputs. Due to the high switching frequency,  the converter size is very small, only 23mm x 22mm for both outputs, and the inductor  height is only 3mm. The high density and thickness of the design plus the 2MHz  switching frequency make this  solution suitable for automotive console  applications, where 2MHz switching frequency  is preferred, and computing, industrial, consumer and telecom power systems requiring small size and a very  thin profile. eGaN FETs provide the fast switching, high efficiency and small size that can  meet the stringent power-density requirements of these leading-edge  applications, says EPC. The EPC9160 reference design uses the EPC2055 enhancement-mode GaN FET and the LTC7890 two-phase  analog buck controller with  integrated GaN drivers.
