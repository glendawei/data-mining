Canada invests CDN$240m in semiconductor and photonics industries Canada’s government has announced the Semiconductor Challenge  Callout, providing CDN$150m through its Strategic Innovation Fund to make  targeted investments to build on Canada’s domestic strengths associated with  the development and supply of semiconductors. He also announced CDN$90m in  funding for the National Research Council of Canada’s Canadian  Photonics Fabrication Centre (CPFC). The Challenge represents Canada’s initial commitment to investing  in innovation projects that aim to reinforce and scale up the country’s  semiconductor ecosystem. The government is calling on businesses to identify  ambitious, transformative proposals in the priority areas of research,  commercialization, and expanded semiconductor manufacturing capacity. This aims  to help the Canadian semiconductor industry enhance its role in the integrated  North American information and communications technology  supply chain. Canada’s government says that it is monitoring signs of strain in  critical supply chains and infrastructure as the economy recovers. The  government is also working closely with the USA and global partners to enhance  supply chain security for key commodities and sectors. Canada’s semiconductor sector includes over 100 homegrown and  multi-national companies conducting R&D. Its manufacturing base includes  over 30 applied research laboratories and five commercial facilities in  areas such as compound semiconductors, micro-electro-mechanical systems  (MEMS) and advanced packaging.
