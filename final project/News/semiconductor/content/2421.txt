NeoPhotonics shipping 53Gbaud PAM4 driver ICs for 100G and 400G hyperscale data-center networks NeoPhotonics Corp of San Jose, CA, USA – a  vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of silicon photonics and  hybrid photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based lasers, modules and  subsystems for high-speed communications – says that it has shipped more than 1 million single and quad drivers for PAM4 transceivers used  in hyperscale data-center networks. NeoPhotonics’ 53Gbaud PAM4 driver IC is a linear, differential  driver based on gallium arsenide  (GaAs) and optimized for 1 x 100Gbps, 4 x 100Gbps and 8 x 100Gbps  PAM4-based applications. The drivers are in volume production and provide a  high RF output voltage swing with  high linearity and are suited to modulating silicon photonics Mach-Zehnder modulators  (MZM) used in 400G data-center transceivers, while maintaining what is claimed  to be exceptional quaternary transmitter dispersion eye closure (TDECQ).
