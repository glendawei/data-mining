Source Photonics demos 50G PAM4 SFP56 transceivers for 5G front-haul In booth #2901 at the Optical Fiber  Communication conference (OFC 2022)  in San Diego (8-10 March), Source Photonics Inc of West Hills,  CA, USA (which provides optical connectivity products for data centers,  metro and access networks) is giving a live demonstration of its 50G  SFP56 transceivers with industry partners (specifically, Viaviâ€™s 50G ONA-1000  optical traffic testing solutions). Source Photonics officially launched the 50G PAM4 SFP56 product  portfolio for 5G front-haul networks last September. As global operators  accelerate the deployment of 5G networks, promote the differentiated  application of 5G multi-services, and release more spectrum resources, 5G  networks present higher bandwidth requirements for front-haul. Currently, the  25Gb/s eCPRI interface is the most widely used solution for 5G front-haul  networks. When the 5G spectrum bandwidth exceeds 100M, one base station requires 6x 25Gb/s eCPRI  interfaces and a total of 12x 25Gb/s SFP28 optical modules. The 50G SFP56  achieves 50% port savings by  upgrading the rate of one transceiver to 50Gb/s, creating flexibility for  further improvement of wireless forward bandwidth. To meet the most pressing bandwidth requirements of global  customers, Source Photonics has  introduced 50G LR and FR PAM4 SFP56 optical modules, which support 10km and  2km, respectively. The product meets the range of industrial-temperature  applications with power consumption as low as 1.5W. This series of products  uses the 25G distributed feedback  (DFB) laser developed in-house by Source Photonics  to provide low power consumption,  short latency and cost-effective transceiver solutions for 5G front-haul  networks. Leveraging in-house vertically integrated optics and ICs, these  modules support interoperability with previous generations of 25G SFP28 and 10G  SFP+ optical transceivers. Both modules comply with the corresponding 50GBASE-R  specifications (as defined in the IEEE standards) and offer 50G PAM4 electrical  and optical interfaces. Source Photonics says that it has conducted in-depth cooperation  with leading 5G equipment manufacturers, and qualification is progressing  smoothly. The 50G LR SFP56 and 50G FR SFP56 are the most urgent general-purpose  applications today. The development of 50G Bidi SFP56, 50G WDM SFP56 and other  related products has also been launched, which will provide more diversified,  more flexible and more cost-effective products.
