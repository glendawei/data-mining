NeoPhotonics transceivers included in OIF 400ZR interoperability demo At the Optical Fiber  Communication conference (OFC 2022)  in San Diego (8-10 March),  NeoPhotonics Corp of San Jose, CA, USA –  a vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of silicon photonics and  hybrid photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based lasers, modules and  subsystems for high-speed communications – says that its OSFP and  QSFP-DD 400ZR transceivers are included in the OIF 400ZR interoperability and  CMIS demonstrations. At this year’s OFC, OIF is hosting its  largest demonstration of interoperability to date, featuring five key  technology areas – 400ZR optics; co-packaging architectures; common electrical  I/O (CEI) channels; FlexE (Flex Ethernet) definitions and Common Management  Interface Specification (CMIS) implementations. The interoperability demos are  both live and static at OIF’s booth, #5101, during OFC. “Interoperability is a key element to enable widespread adoption  of 400ZR,” says chairman & CEO Tim Jenks. “Our successful interoperability  with different manufacturers’ modules, switches, routers and test equipment  helps to establish and expand the 400ZR eco-system,” he adds.
