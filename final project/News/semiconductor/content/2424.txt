MACOM demos TIA and laser driver interoperability with Broadcom 100Gbps VCSEL, photodetector and PAM-4 DSP up to 1.6Tbps In its booth #3927 at the Optical Networking and Communications  Conference (OFC 2022) in San Diego, MACOM Technology Solutions Inc of Lowell, MA,  USA (which makes semiconductors, components and subassemblies for analog RF,  microwave, millimeter-wave and photonic applications) is collaborating  to give a live demonstration of interoperability of Broadcom’s vertical-cavity  surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), photodetector and PAM-4 DSP (digital signal  processor) with MACOM’s VCSEL driver and transimpedance amplifier (TIA) for  100Gbps-per-lane multi-mode fiber  (MMF) applications. The pairing for this 100m MMF demonstration includes MACOM’s MATA-39434 4x100Gbps PAM-4 TIA and MALD-39435 4x100Gbps PAM-4 VCSEL driver  along with Broadcom’s VCSEL (AFCD-V84LPx), photodetector (BPD3056-4) and 7nm  Portofino DSP (BCM878xx) for 100Gbps/lane up to 1.6Tbps short-reach modules  (SFP, QSFP, OSFP, QSFP-DD) and COB on-board optics. MACOM’s chipset delivers IEEE standard specified performance and  enables low power consumption, best-in-class linear performance, low noise  and low latency for short-reach MMF applications. The firm’s devices are also  targeted for the upcoming Terabit BiDi MSA (multi-source agreement)  specification supporting 1.6Tbps per module. “Our customers require high-performance solutions to enable their  data-center applications,” says Marek Tlalka, senior director,  High-Performance Analog, MACOM. “This collaboration builds on our recently  demonstrated single-mode interoperability offering the industry another proof point  towards the interoperability of optics and DSPs with MACOM’s laser drivers and  TIAs and a path to shorter design cycles for high-speed optical module  manufacturers,” he adds. “Broadcom’s 100Gbps PAM-4 DSPs, VCSELs and photodetectors along  with MACOM’s TIAs and laser drivers provide industry-leading performance at the  lowest power for short-reach, high-speed optical modules,” claims I-Hsing Tan,  director of product marketing, Optical Systems Division, Broadcom.  “Displaying leading performance at 100m for MMF applications highlights Broadcom’s  interoperability with various components needed to develop industry-leading  optical modules.”
