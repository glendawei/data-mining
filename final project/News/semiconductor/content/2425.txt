Riber wins Asian order for extra MBE 6000 production system Riber S.A. of Bezons,  France – which designs and makes molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems and  evaporators – says that an  industrial client in Asia has  ordered an additional MBE 6000 production system for a total of several  million euros. For  delivery in 2022, the new system will reinforce the customer’s existing fleet  of reactors for producing microwave device materials. Riber  says that, with nearly 40 machines sold since its launch in 1999, the MBE 6000 is now  established as the benchmark MBE system for the mass production of  electronic and optoelectronic device material used in terrestrial telecoms (4G,  5G) and in fiber optic  networks. Riber  will issue its full-year 2021 earnings on 13 April.
