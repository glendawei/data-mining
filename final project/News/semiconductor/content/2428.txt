Vector produces PCSEL arrays emitting four concurrent 1300nm wavelengths Photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL)  firm Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK has produced 1300nm,  all-semiconductor PCSELs targeting 800Gb datacoms applications. The PCSEL  arrays emit four concurrent 1300nm wavelengths, with a side-mode suppression  ratio (SMSR) of about 35dB. “Vector Photonics’ 1300nm compound semiconductor lasers  enable new levels of PCSEL commercialization for datacoms applications,” says chief  technology officer Dr Richard Taylor. “Unlike incumbent DFB  [distributed feedback] and EEL [edge-emitting laser] data-center laser  technologies, PCSELs deliver both the high speed and high power required, in  the same device. PCSELs are surface emitting, with light coming from the  top of the laser not the side, which vastly reduces packaging costs,” he adds.  “We now have four 1300nm wavelengths emitting from a monolithic PCSEL array,  rather than four separate chips, simplifying post-production assembly and  significantly reducing packaging costs.”
