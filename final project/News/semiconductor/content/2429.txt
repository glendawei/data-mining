Lumentum demonstrating and previewing innovations at OFC Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose, CA, USA (which designs  and makes photonics products for optical networks and lasers for industrial and  consumer markets) is  participating in partner demonstrations and highlighting its portfolio of  future-ready solutions at the Optical Fiber  Communication Conference (OFC 2022)  in San Diego (8-10 March) at both  the Lumentum booth #3415 and partner booths. Lumentum is  demonstrating its flex-coherent 400G CFP2-DCO modules that enable  next-generation optical transport networks and data-center interconnects with  NTT Network Innovation Laboratories  in booth #5041 and Telecom Infra Project (TIP) in booth #3629. NTT will  demonstrate live 400Gbps coherent transmission using a C+L-band line system that will incorporate Lumentum’s  pluggable 400G CFP2-DCO modules (a cost-efficient solution to the  ever-increasing demand for capacity). Additionally,  TIP will demonstrate reliable optical communication links in next-generation  networks using Lumentum’s 400G CFP2-DCO modules in a 400Gbps OpenROADM  interoperability demonstration. In the Optical  Internetworking Forum (OIF) booth #5101, Lumentum is showcasing its 1310nm  distributed feedback (DFB) laser  technology with a high-power continuous-wave (CW) prototype, operating at 200mW  optical power, enabling OIF’s multi-vendor, co-packaged optics demonstration.
