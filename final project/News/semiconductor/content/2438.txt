Navitas  powers fastest smartphone-charging technology from realme at MWC Gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit firm  Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland says that  its GaNFast technology has been selected to deliver a fast-charging solution  for the realme GT Neo 3 smartphone series that saw its global launch  at MWC Barcelona 2022 (28 February  – 3 March). The new 150W charger supplied ‘in-box’ with the GT Neo 3  is the most powerful member of the new ultra-fast smartphone charger category  enabled by GaNFast power ICs. Powered by a Dimensity 8100 chip, the  realme GT Neo 3 features up to 150W UltraDart Charging Architecture  (UDCA), the industry’s fastest and most powerful commercial charging solution.  Advanced heat management and battery protection ensure cool, long-life  operation. The availability of a 150W charger, built  around Navitas GaNFast power ICs, allows users to capitalize on this  technology by charging the phone’s 4500mAhr battery from 0-50% in in just 5 minutes.  At only 58mm x 58mm x 30mm (101cc), the charger achieves  1.5W/cc power density. “Our super flash charging technology  delivers the world’s fastest smartphone charging solution, providing users  of the new realme GT Neo 3 with the flexibility and convenience of  fully charging their phones in the shortest possible time,” says Madhav Sheth, president of realme international business group  and VP of realme. “Gallium nitride ICs have been fundamental to delivering  this step change in performance while keeping charger weight and form factor  as low as possible,” he adds. “This milestone in the ultra-fast charger  sector [the world’s first commercial solution for 150W smartphone charging] is  powered by Navitas GaNFast technology, which has allowed realme to create a new  150W charging benchmark for efficiency, speed and form factor,” says Navitas’  CEO & co-founder Gene Sheridan.
