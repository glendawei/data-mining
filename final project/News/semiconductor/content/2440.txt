NeoPhotonics  demos InP components capable of 120Gbaud operation supporting 800G LR, ZR, and  ZR+ transmission NeoPhotonics Corp of San Jose, CA, USA – a  vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of silicon photonics and  hybrid photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based lasers, modules and  subsystems for high-speed communications – has used its indium phosphide  (InP)-based coherent receiver and coherent modulators, coupled with its  ultra-narrow-linewidth tunable lasers or distributed feedback (DFB) lasers, to  demonstrate 120Gbaud operation in applications ranging from 800G LR  transmission to 400G long-haul transmission. The next-generation DSP baud rate  will be based on 120+Gbaud, and potential applications include 800LR (≤10km),  800ZR for DCI (≤100km), 800ZR+ for metro-core (≤1000km), and 400Gb/s  ultra-long-haul transmission. Demonstrations of this level of performance are  reported and listed below, showing that corresponding high-speed optoelectronic  components are available to match the DSP baud rate  and to enable pluggable or embedded modules at these data rates. Using its InP-based coherent driver modulator (CDM) and intradyne  coherent receiver (ICR) with more than 60GHz bandwidth, NeoPhotonics has  experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of the following transmission  systems at 120+Gbaud: “We are pleased to take this opportunity  to highlight the progress we have made in pushing our high-performance indium phosphide integration technologies to  even higher speeds and over longer distances to enable new potential  applications in cloud and data-center applications,” says chairman & CEO Tim  Jenks. “These 120Gbaud components coupled with our ultra-narrow-linewidth  external-cavity ‘nano’ tunable laser  or our distributed feedback lasers,  along with concurrent DSP advances, could enable pluggable modules to operate  at 800G for applications within and between data centers,  as well as to extend the speed and reach of embedded telecom systems,” he adds. Aspects of these demonstrations are being  discussed in the following presentations at the Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC 2022) in San Diego, CA, USA (8-10 March):
