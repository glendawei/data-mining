POET  launches 400G FR4 and 800G (2x400G FR4) receive optical engines POET Technologies Inc of  Toronto, Ontario, Canada — a designer of photonic integrated circuits  (PICs) for the data-center and telecom markets — has launched its 400G  FR4 and 800G (2x400G FR4) receive (RX) optical engines based on the POET  Optical Interposer hybrid silicon photonics platform. The 400G FR4 receive optical engine  PIC is claimed to be the industry’s only chip-scale integrated (single chip)  version of a FR4 RX optical engine available, with associated performance,  power and cost advantages that apply to a dual 400G FR4 (for an 800G) receive  solution as well. The advantages are derived from the POET Optical Interposer  platform, which enables the integration of ‘best of breed’ photonic  components onto a single chip passively (without any costly active alignment  requirements). In addition, the products demonstrate four unique features that,  when combined, result in a superior solution compared with either standard  free-space optics or standard silicon photonics-based engines, it is  claimed: “We’re excited to begin sampling and  qualification of our 400G/800G FR receivers ahead of our original schedule,”  says chairman & CEO Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “Our advanced and  proprietary hybrid silicon photonics platform technology is uniquely  suited to provide the cost and performance required for 400G and 800G FR4  modules. The product represents a true ‘semiconductorization’ of photonic  engines using traditional pick-and-place bonding equipment and passive  alignment of photonics devices. With Super Photonics Xiamen (SPX), our  joint venture with Sanan IC, we also provide the ability to rapidly scale  production to meet the demands of this fast-growing market,” he adds. “This 400G receiver utilizes a truly  game-changing technology that will make POET’s approach of hybrid silicon photonics  a force to reckon with in the 400G/800G FR4 module market,” comments Ben Chen,  chief technology officer of Surinno Photonics (formerly Hengtong-Rockley).  “POET Technologies has been able to utilize its platform concept to provide  easy-to-use optical engines for the data communications market with  rapid deployment and demonstrations of 100G/200G TX-RX engines and also 400G  FR4 engines.” LightCounting has forecasted that the  market for 400G and 800G Ethernet transceiver modules will exceed $2bn annually  by 2024. The 400G and 800G optical engines will be manufactured and  provided by SPX.
