Lumentum increases share  repurchase authorization to $1bn Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose,  CA, USA (which designs and makes photonics products for optical networks and  lasers for industrial and consumer markets) says that its board of directors has authorized an increase of  its share repurchase program to $1bn  which is currently underway and will now expire in May 2024. This supersedes  the previous share repurchase program of $700m over two years that was announced in May 2021. “Given our favorable growth outlook with  expected double-digit revenue growth over the coming years, and our strong  financial profile, we believe that this buyback program will enhance our  shareholder value,” says president & CEO Alan Lowe.
