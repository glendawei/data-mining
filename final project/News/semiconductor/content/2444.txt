Luminus releases MP-5050-250R high-efficacy  mid-power LEDs Luminus Devices Inc of  Sunnyvale, CA, USA – which designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology  (SST) light sources for illumination markets – has announced the launch and immediate  availability of a new high-efficacy family of 5050 mid-power LEDs designed with  sulfur resistance for high-performance and long-term reliability in outdoor  lighting and horticulture applications. The new MP-5050-250R high-performance LEDs  provide low thermal resistance, up to 185lumens/Watt, high photosynthetic photon flux (PPF)/Watt, and  color rendering index (CRI) options of 70, 80 and 90 minimum. In addition,  they are compatible with automatic placement equipment and are RoHs and REACH  compliant. Customers who are listing their products  with DLC can leverage the MP-5050-250R series’ 17,000-hour LM-80 report under a  wide range of operating conditions. The MP-5050 mid-power LEDs allow illumination  engineers and designers to develop lighting solutions with maximum efficacy,  brightness and overall quality, says the firm. “Our customers are turning to 5050s to  replace multiple 3030s in horticulture or to replace 3535 die-on-ceramic LEDs  in outdoor applications,” notes Tom Jory, VP of illumination marketing. “The  250R series, with sulfur resistance and best-in-class efficacy, is  now our flagship in the 5050 line, which we will continue to expand with more  voltage options in the near future.” The product line is now available through Luminus’ authorized  distributors.
