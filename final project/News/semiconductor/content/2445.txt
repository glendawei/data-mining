Sivers Photonics showcasing  InP100 product platform at OFC Sivers  Semiconductors AB of Kista, Sweden (which supplies chips and integrated  modules) says that its subsidiary Sivers Photonics of Glasgow, Scotland, UK is exhibiting  and speaking at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC 2022) in San Diego, CA, USA (6-10 March). In booth #5728 in the exhibition area of the San Diego Convention Centre from 8-10 March, the Sivers Photonics  team of technical experts will be discussing the InP100 product platform, a  common design and manufacturing framework that uses established process modules  to produce a broad range of active III-V photonic devices, including high-power  distributed feedback (DFB) lasers and reflective semiconductor optical  amplifier (SOA) chips. “This advanced 4” indium phosphide  manufacturing platform is enabling the acceleration of silicon photonics  (SiPh) for a wide variety of high-volume, low-cost applications, including data center,  artificial intelligence (AI) and optical sensing,” says Sivers Photonics’  managing director Billy McLaughlin. Also, chief technology officer Dr Andy  McKee is taking part in the panel session ‘Progress and Roadmap in Silicon Photonics  Foundries and Supply Chains’ (9 March, 08:00-10:00), discussing how  commercial foundry services and supply chain enablement are playing a critical  role in the silicon photonics ecosystem.
