Achieving thicker AlGaN material Georgia Institute of Technology and Arizona  State University in the USA have used non-planar growth (NPG) of aluminium  gallium nitride (AlGaN) on patterned GaN on sapphire to create material with  thicknesses beyond critical with a view to ultraviolet laser diodes [Frank Mehnke et al, J. Appl. Phys., v131, p073103, 2022]. Lattice mismatch and thermal expansion  mismatch between AlGaN and GaN often lea to cracking of the material from the  build up of stress.
