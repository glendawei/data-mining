Transphorm demonstrating 99% efficiency power switching with 1200V GaN power transistor At the International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices  and ICs (ISPSD 2022) in Vancouver, Canada (22-26 May), Transphorm Inc of Goleta, near  Santa Barbara, CA, USA — which designs and manufactures JEDEC- and  AEC-Q101-qualified gallium nitride (GaN) field-effect transistors  (FETs) for high-voltage power conversion — is to demonstrate R&D  results from its 1200V GaN device. The 1200V GaN device delivers greater than 99% efficiency and is  said to perform well against a leading silicon carbide  (SiC) MOSFET of similar on-resistance. Partially funded by the ARPA-E CIRCUITS  program, Transphorm is developing the technology for electric vehicle (EV) mobility and infrastructure  power systems as well as industrial  and renewable energy systems. Transphorm  says that the milestone further strengthens its ability to support the broadest  range of power—from 45W to 10K+ kW—across the widest range of cross-industry  applications compared with any other GaN supplier today, it is claimed.
