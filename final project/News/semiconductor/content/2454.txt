TRUMPF introducing longer-wavelength VCSELs for datacoms In booth 2423 at the  Optical Fiber Conference (OFC 2022) in San Diego, USA  (8–10 March), TRUMPF Photonic Components GmbH of Ulm, Germany  (part of the TRUMPF Group) – which manufactures vertical-cavity  surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and photodiodes for the consumer electronics, datacoms,  industrial sensing, heating and automotive markets – is to show  its existing 850nm product portfolio and its future roadmap for longer  wavelengths. The company is hence introducing  VCSELs with wavelengths above 940nm, addressing the market requirements for  broader temperature ranges, higher product robustness and service life.

TRUMPF has also just completed its  first multi-million-Euro investment tranche in its production site in Ulm, in  order to upgrade its manufacturing platform and to support further business  growth. The firm says that it is building on more than 20 years of  experience in the market with the strategy of not only designing standard modules  but also customized solutions for high-speed and high-performance VCSELs and  photodiodes.
