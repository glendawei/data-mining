POET and Liobate Technologies collaborate on ultra-high-performance PICs POET Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada — a designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer and  photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the data-center and telecom  markets — has announced a  collaboration with China-based Liobate Technologies Ltd to incorporate advanced thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators onto POET’s  Optical Engines supporting  power-efficient ultra-high-bandwidth electro-optic conversion for data-center  and telecom applications. The multi-phase co-development project is initially  focused on delivering and commercializing a POET 400/800Gps Transmit and  Receive Optical Engine. “We are very pleased to be working with one of the leading  companies in TFLN modulators,” comments POET’s chairman & CEO Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “Of all the materials  currently under development for high-speed modulators, including monolithic  silicon, indium phosphide and  advanced polymers, we believe that TFLN offers the most promise for early  commercial deployment and potential long-term success,” he adds. “The POET  Optical Interposer platform is a  hybrid integration platform, which provides the flexibility to utilize the most  appropriate modulator for specific applications. We are pursuing multiple paths  for light modulation, including silicon, TFLN-based electro-optic modulators,  as well as directly modulated lasers  (DML) that do not require a separate modulating device. Our goal is to match  components to the superior optical and electrical performance characteristics  of the POET Optical Interposer,  enabling POET to introduce ground-breaking performance in Optical Engines and Optical Interposer-based photonic integrated circuits for high-speed transceivers and  co-packaged optics applications.” Historically, lithium niobate  has been one of the most mature, reliable and low-cost substances used in  modulators but, because of its bulk and low power efficiency,  it has not been widely used in high-speed, high-density optical interconnects  in cloud data centers. Known for its  inherent high bandwidth, low insertion loss,  nonlinear optical qualities and extreme reliability, it was not until the  recent development of thin-film lithium niobate  by a small number of companies globally that the use of this material is now  enabling new applications in millimeter-wave data communications,  telecommunications, sensing and quantum computing, notes POET.
