Navitas announces ‘redemption fair market value’ for warrants Gallium nitride (GaN) power  integrated circuit firm Navitas Semiconductor Corp of  El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland has announced the ‘redemption fair  market value’ in connection with its upcoming redemption of all outstanding  warrants to purchase shares of its Class A common stock. In early February, Navitas announced that it will redeem all of  its publicly traded and privately held warrants that remain unexercised at 5pm New York City time on 7 March,  for a redemption price of $0.10 per warrant. The ‘redemption fair market value’ is used to  determine the number of shares that will be issued to warrant holders who elect  to exercise their warrants on a ‘cashless’ basis before the redemption date, subject  to the terms of Navitas’ previously issued notice of redemption. Navitas’ warrant agent Continental Stock Transfer & Trust  Company has delivered a notice of redemption fair market value to  registered holders of outstanding warrants, informing them that: 
  * based on the redemption date, the redemption fair market value  is $10.33;  and 
  * as a result, holders who exercise their warrants on a ‘cashless’  basis before 5pm New York City time on  the redemption date will be entitled to receive 0.261 shares of Navitas common stock per warrant  exercised. Warrant holders have until immediately before 5pm New York City time on  the redemption date to exercise their warrants. Payment upon exercise of the  warrants may be made either (i) in cash, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share of common stock or (ii) on a ‘cashless’  basis in which the exercising holder will receive 0.261 shares of common stock  per warrant exercised. Warrants may be exercised on a ‘cashless’ basis regardless of the  market value of the common stock at the time of exercise and even if such  value is less than the warrant exercise price of $11.50  per share. If a holder of warrants would be entitled to receive a fractional  share of stock as a result of warrants exercised at one time, the number of  shares the holder will be entitled to receive will be rounded down to the  nearest whole number of shares. Any warrants that remain unexercised at 5pm New York City time on the redemption date will be void and no  longer exercisable, and the holders of those warrants will be entitled to  receive only the redemption price of $0.10 per  warrant.
