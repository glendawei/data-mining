‘Semiconductors 4 Photonics’ webinar to take place on 8 March Organized in partnership with Holland Semiconductors, High Tech NL,  and supported by the Welsh Government, the  ‘Semiconductors 4 Photonic’ webinar on 8 March will explore the  future potential of the semiconductor-enabled photonics markets, and focus on  building and strengthening existing relationships between the UK and  Netherlands. Compound semiconductor materials play a key role in driving  photonics applications of today and tomorrow. They have been at the forefront  of the revolution in image sensing and will continue to support innovations in  photonics applications. Two of the biggest future developments for photonics  applications enabled by compound semiconductor materials are in healthcare  wearable devices to monitor diseases and infections (including glucose levels  and coronaviruses) and in remote sensing technology (used for accurate  dimensional measuring, object scanning for replication by 3D printing, and  the virtual placement of objects for augmented reality apps such as  shopping and gaming). According to a recent report from the UK Photonics Leadership  Group, companies manufacturing and delivering services based on photonics  technology in the UK produced £14.5bn in output in 2020 and contributed £6.5bn  of gross added-value to the UK economy annually, employing 76,700 people in the  UK at a productivity of £85,000 per employee. This is comparable to the  pharmaceutical and fintech industries, making it one of the most important  sectors for the UK economy, the report notes.
