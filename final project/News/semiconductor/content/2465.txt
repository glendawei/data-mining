InGaAs/colloidal nanocrystal infrared detector Researchers in France have combined indium  gallium arsenide (InGaAs) III-V nanowires with colloidal mercury telluride (HgTe) II-VI nanocrystals (NCs) to create a photodiode  sensitive to light in the 1.6-2.0μm short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) range [Adrien Khalili et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v120, p051101,  2022]. The team from Sorbonne Université, ONERA-The French Aerospace  Lab, and University Lille, comment: “For a long time, the design of IR sensors  has opposed narrow-bandgap III–V  semiconductors against their colloidal II–VI counterpart. Here, we demonstrate that Van der Waals heterostructures can be  obtained from these two types of semiconductors.” Typical Van der Waals heterostructures  include graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides. It is hard to see how  these structures can be scaled up to mass production from laboratory-scale  flakes measuring at most a few tens of microns. By contrast,  large-production-scale III-V materials are basic to ubiquitous light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. Narrow-gap nanocrystals such as HgTe are  used to absorb the infrared tail of the solar spectrum in photovoltaic devices  and in infrared cameras.
