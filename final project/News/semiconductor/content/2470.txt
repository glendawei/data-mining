Veeco grows revenue 28% in 2021 For fourth-quarter  2021, epitaxial deposition and process equipment maker  Veeco Instruments Inc of Plainview, NY, USA has reported revenue of $153m, up 1.8%  on $150.2m last quarter and 10.2% on $138.9m a year ago, driven primarily by strong  performance in the semiconductor market. Semiconductor  (Front-End and Back-End, as well as EUV Mask Blank systems and  Advanced Packaging) contributed $65.4m (43% of total revenue), up 13.9% on $57.4m  a year ago. This is driven by (1) multiple multi-tool orders from a variety of  customers for laser annealing (to add capacity for advanced nodes as well  as trailing-node applications) and (2) advanced packaging lithography  systems (since demand remains high for applications such as flip-chip bumping,  fan-out wafer-level packaging and heterogeneous integration). Compound Semiconductor (Power Electronics, RF  Filter & Device applications, and Photonics including specialty, mini- and  micro-LEDs, VCSELs, Laser Diodes) contributed $34.7m (23% of total revenue), up 48.9% on $23.3m (15%  of revenue) last quarter, driven by multiple shipments of wet-processing  systems to photonics customers as well as 5G RF customers adding filter  and power amplifier capacity. Data Storage  (equipment for thin-film magnetic head manufacturing) contributed $36.5m (24%  of total revenue), down 7.1% on $39.3m last quarter. 
  Scientific &  Other (research institutions and other applications) contributed $16.3m (10% of  total revenue), up 43% on $11.4m last quarter.  By region, the  Asia-Pacific region (excluding China) comprised 26% of revenue (down on 48% a year  ago) driven by semiconductor system sales, the USA 37% (up on 26%) driven  by data storage customers, China 25% (up on 14%) driven  primarily by semiconductor systems (with particular strength in trailing-node  laser annealing) as well as compound semiconductor systems (led by  wet-processing and ion-beam systems for RF power amplifiers), and Europe,  Middle-East & Africa (EMEA) 12% (level year-on-year), with the rest of the  world remaining less than 1%. “I think of 2021 as an inflection point at Veeco, where we completed  our transformation, and we’re now squarely executing our growth strategy,” says  CEO Bill  Miller. “We continued our focus on innovation with R&D  projects supporting laser annealing, ion-beam deposition for semiconductor  applications, and MOCVD [metal-organic chemical vapor deposition] for  power electronics and photonics applications.” Full-year revenue grew  by 28% from $454.2m in 2020 to $583.3m for 2021 (exceeding the revised guidance  of $580m, and the initial guidance of just 10% growth), driven  by Semiconductor and Data Storage performance. 
  Semiconductor contributed $247.1m (43% of total revenue), up 49%  on 2020’s $165.9m (36% of revenue). “We had a record year in our semiconductor  market, and we had a record year with our wet-processing systems,” says Miller. Compound Semiconductor contributed  $107m, roughly flat on 2020 (although shrinking from 24% to 18% of total revenue).  However, normalizing for about $20m of one-time commodity  LED-related MOCVD system sales of slow-moving inventory in 2020, this  represents underlying growth in the areas where Veeco is now focused. 
  Data Storage contributed  $168.8m (29% of total revenue), up 37% on 2020’s $123.3m (27% of revenue), as  hard-disk-drive customers continued adding capacity for their thin-film magnetic  head manufacturing. 
  Scientific &  Other (research institutions and other applications) contributed $60.5m (10% of  total revenue), up 6% on 2020’s $57m.  By region, the  Asia-Pacific (excluding China) comprised 35% of revenue (down from 39% in 2020)  due mainly to semiconductor customers, the USA 38% (up  from 32%) driven by data storage customers, EMEA 9% (down from 16%),  and China 18% (up from 13%), with the rest of the world remaining less than 1%. 
  On a non-GAAP basis, full-year  gross margin has fallen from 43.3% in 2020 to 42% for 2021. However, despite  falling from 42.6% last quarter, Q4/2021 gross margin was 42.4%, still  up on 41.3% a year ago. “We were able to maintain this level of gross margin in spite  of the challenging supply chain environment while continuing to invest in  service capabilities and supporting our evaluation systems in the field,” chief  financial officer John Kiernan. “Throughout 2021, we saw increasing  challenges as the year progressed and experienced higher logistics costs,  inflationary pressures on materials and longer lead-times. Our  supply chain team has done a fantastic job of mitigating most issues they  encountered,” he comments. “For the year, there was about a  one percentage point impact to our gross margin. We expect the  situation to be similar for a few more quarters, the impact of which has been  incorporated in our previously provided guidance for 2022.” Operating expenses were $40m, roughly level with $39.6m last  quarter and $39.7m a year ago (and below the expected $41-43m). Full-year  operating expenses rose from $144m in 2020 to $158.5m for 2021, reflecting  R&D investments made to drive future growth as well as higher variable  SG&A expenses associated with an increase in revenue and order intake. However,  OpEx as a percentage of revenue was reduced year-on-year from 32% to 27%,  providing operating leverage to the company. Net income has risen  further, from $15m ($0.30 per diluted share) a year ago and $20.5m ($0.40 per  diluted share) last quarter to $22.6m ($0.43 per diluted share), near  the top end of the guidance of $14-23m ($0.27-0.45 per diluted share).  Full-year net income has grown from $42.3m ($0.86 per diluted share) in 2020 to  2021’s $73.6m ($1.43 per diluted share, up 66%, and exceeding the $1.35  guidance). CapEx during the quarter fell back to $9.2m (including $8m used  for the build-out of the new facility in San Jose), bringing full-year  CapEx to $41m (including $31m used for the expansion). “We made great progress  on our capacity expansion and shipped first systems from the new San Jose  facility [expecting to be fully transitioned into the new space by the end of  Q3/2022, providing twice the manufacturing output of the existing San Jose  facility], and we enhanced both our service capability and our service  offerings, focusing on our customers’ needs for system uptime and spare-parts  availability,” says Miller. Cash flow from operations was $17m in Q4, and $68m for full-year  2021 (up 58% year-on-year). However, cash and short-term investments fell by $111m from $336m  to $225m, due mainly to convertible notes repurchased during the quarter. In Q4, Veeco repurchased $112m of convertible notes (due in January  2023) for $117m in cash (leaving just $20m of 2023 notes remaining, together  still with $133m and $125m of convertible notes due in 2025 and 2027,  respectively). With long-term debt cut by $102m to $229m (represents the  carrying value of the total $278m of convertible notes remaining), annual  cash interest expense has hence been cut from $12.9m to $9.9m. 
  In 2021, Veeco also entered into a $150m revolving credit  facility. “With our improved balance sheet, along with our credit facility, we  have the flexibility and capital to focus on driving long-term growth across  the business,” believes Kiernan. “We successfully  advanced our product innovation and penetrated new customers, enhanced our  service capabilities, increased our manufacturing capacity, improved our  capital structure, solidified our governance and commitment to corporate  responsibility,” summarizes Miller. “Demand in our  semiconductor and compound semiconductor markets is exceptionally  strong and we exited 2021 with order momentum, increased backlog and exciting  opportunities that will support our growth strategy,” he adds. Order intake grew faster than revenue throughout the year, with order  bookings of $661m in full-year 2021, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. Order backlog is hence $440m, up 20% year-on-year. By market  segment, Semiconductor backlog more than doubled and Compound Semiconductor  backlog grew by 47%, while Data Storage backlog fell by 51% as customers  slowed the pace of new orders for capacity additions. “With Q4’s performance, we exit 2021 on a positive note with  strong order momentum, increased backlog and focus on execution,” says Miller. For first-quarter  2022, Veeco expects revenue of $145-165m, gross margin of 42-44%, operating  expenses of $42-44m, and net income of $15-26m ($0.28-0.44 per diluted share). “We’re currently experiencing strong demand from  laser annealing, EUV mask blank production and  advanced packaging, and expect this demand to continue and drive  significant semiconductor growth in 2022,” says Miller. “We expect significant growth in the compound semiconductor  market in 2022, which is based on our backlog and visibility of MOCVD and other  systems selling primarily into photonics applications and, secondarily,  GaN power,” notes Kiernan. “We’re beginning to see traction in the  photonics market with a recent announcement for a multi-system order for our  Lumina platform,” says Miller. “Longer term, we believe we’re well positioned  for the micro-LED and 8-inch GaN power opportunities with both our Lumina  and Propel platforms.” Based on the improved backlog and current visibility (expecting  slightly higher revenue in second-half 2022 than first-half 2022), Veeco is  reaffirming its recently provided full-year 2022 revenue outlook of $640-680m.  This would be up 13-14% year-on-year, driven mainly by 35% growth in both the  Compound Semiconductor market and the Semiconductor market (including  nearly 50% growth for laser annealing systems, which will be Veeco’s  largest business in 2022), more than offsetting a 35% drop for  Data Storage. Also, Veeco continues to target diluted EPS of $1.50-1.70  per share. “We expect to grow revenue in 2022, while improving our gross  margin as we make progress toward our long-term target model [of 45%],” concludes  Miller.
