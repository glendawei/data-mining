Luminus adds 5000K Salud technology to CCT-tunable modules Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA, USA –  which designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology (SST)  light sources for illumination markets – has expanded its human-centric lighting  portfolio with the introduction of the Salud CCT-tunable modules. The 5000K Salud technology has now been incorporated into Luminus’  CCT-tunable modules (CTM) to provide lighting designers with high melanopic lux  without using 6500K correlated color   temperature, avoiding light with too much blue tint. The 5000K Salud channel  has a melanopic ratio of 0.97 to keep people energized and alert during the  day, while the 2200K channel has a melanopic ratio of 0.33 to provide a  relaxing environment and allow the body to prepare for sleep. With two  independent channels, the user can also tune the light to any CCT in between  5000K and 2200K to enable a smooth transition from daytime to evening. As many public spaces open back up with health and wellness as a  key consideration, the Salud technology incorporated into these modules enables  the 5000K channel to meet the WELL Building  requirements for high melanopic lux in the vertical plane without having to  over-light the environment, says Luminus. Salud technology helps to create a  healthy, productive and comfortable environment and is suitable for offices,  schools, factories, shops and public spaces, adds the firm. “Lighting specifiers  are delighted that our 90 CRI [color rendering index] CCT-tunable product  offering is now enhanced with Salud 5000K technology, enabling easy compliance  with WELL, while the ideal warm 2200K CCT provides evening relaxation,” Tom  Jory, VP of illumination marketing. The new CTM modules are exact drop-in replacements, with same footprint  and electrical characteristics as the 9mm, 14mm, 18mm and 22mm CCT-tunable  modules from Luminus. All Luminus two-channel CCT-tunable modules are now available through the  firm’s authorized distributors.
