GaN power IC firm Navitas doubles revenue in 2021 For fourth-quarter  2021, gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit  firm Navitas Semiconductor Corp of  El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin,  Ireland has reported revenue of $7.3m, up 30% on $5.6m last quarter and 55% on  $4.7m a year ago. Full-year revenue doubled from $11.8m in 2020 to $23.7m in  2021. Founded  in 2014, Navitas introduced what it claimed to be the first commercial GaN  power integrated circuits. Its proprietary GaNFast power ICs monolithically  integrate GaN power field-effect transistors (FETs) and GaN drive plus control  and protection circuits in a single SMT package to enable faster charging, higher  power density and greater energy savings for mobile,  consumer, enterprise, eMobility and new energy markets. “2021 was a pivotal  year for Navitas as we doubled revenue and became a public company,” says  co-founder & CEO Gene Sheridan. “We have strengthened our leadership  position in the mobile market, with all of the top mobile players shipping or  developing their next-gen chargers with Navitas,” he adds. In mobile fast chargers, the number  of customer designs released to production increased by 75% to over 170 by the  end of 2021, with an increase of over 100% in the number of customer designs in  development, now at over 240 projects. Tier-1 ‘in-box’ wins have doubled, which  include Dell, Lenovo, Xiaomi, Vivo, Motorola and LG among others. At year end, over 35 million GaN ICs had shipped with  zero reported GaN field failures. GaNFast power ICs with new GaNSense  technology are in production with Lenovo, Xiaomi and Vivo, and Navitas now has  145 patents issued or pending. On a non-GAAP basis, gross  margin was 44.3% in Q4/2021, up on 37.7% a year earlier. Full-year gross margin  rose from 33.2% to 45.4%. However, operating  expenses have risen from $8.1m a year ago to $10.1m, and full-year operating  expenses from $21.6m in 2020 to $35.3m for 2021. Quarterly net loss has  risen further, from $6.37m ($0.39 per share) a year ago to $6.95m ($0.07 per  share). Full-year net loss has hence risen from $17.8m ($1.10 per share) in  2020 to $24.8m ($0.63 per share) in 2021. “Our expansion plans  into data-center, solar and EV are well underway with sampling of our  high-power GaN ICs and the opening of our new design centers dedicated to  data-centers and EV applications,” says Sheridan. Navitas expects revenue  to fall back slightly to $6-7m in first-quarter 2022, but full-year 2022  revenue should still double to about $48m. Gross margin should be 44% for both the  quarter and the full year. Operating expenses are expected to be rise to $13m for  Q1 and $58m for full-year 2022 (which includes a full year of expenses  associated with being a public company).
