EPC launches 2kW, two-phase, regulated-output-voltage 48V/14V bidirectional converter Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of  El Segundo, CA, USA – which makes enhancement-mode  gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power  field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for power  management applications – has  announced the availability of the EPC9165,  a 2kW, two-phase 48V–14V bidirectional converter that operates with 97% peak  efficiency in a small footprint, suitable for high-density and high-power 48V  battery packs such as those required for eMobility and light mobility. The solution is scalable; two converters can be paralleled for  4kW, three converters for 6kW or only one phase can be used for 1kW. In this  application, the output voltage is 14V; however, since the topology is a  hard-switching buck converter, the output voltage can be easily adjusted for  voltages between 12V and 36V.
