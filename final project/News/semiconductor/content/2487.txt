CrayoNano licensing deal gives access to 180+ extra patents CrayoNano AS of Trondheim, Norway – which  develops and manufactures semiconductor components based on patented and  proprietary nanomaterials technology – has signed a licensing agreement with what it describes as a  “renowned LED industry player”. CrayoNano will have access to and use of more  than 180 patents, particularly in LED chip processing, fabrication, packaging  and manufacturing – supplementing CrayoNano’s patent portfolio covering  nanowire and graphene-based technologies in general and UV-C LED products specifically. The license agreement triples CrayoNano’s patent portfolio to more  than 300 patents covering UV-C and LED technology. Under this IP license  agreement, the firm is expanding its intellectual property  with complementary technology required for the industrialization of its  nanowire and hybrid material technology in mass-market, high-volume  disinfecting UV-C LED products. “The additional patents and technology enables strong protection  in the market for UV-C LED products,  and the access to high-volume manufacturing know-how and technology,” says CrayoNano’s  CEO Jo Uthus. “This will fast track  the industrialization of our technology into the planned multi-million unit manufacturing capability in-line  with CrayoNano’s fab-lite business model.”
