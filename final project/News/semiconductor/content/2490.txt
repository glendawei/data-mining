Navitas GaN ICs to be highlighted at APEC At the Applied Power  Electronics Conference (APEC 2022) in  Houston, TX, USA (20-24 March), gallium nitride (GaN) power  integrated circuit firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA  and Dublin, Ireland will highlight technology for mobile fast chargers,  plus expansion into higher-power markets including data-center, solar and  electric vehicles (EVs). GaN runs up to  20x faster than silicon and enables up to 3x more power, 40% energy savings and  3x faster charging in half the size and weight, says Navitas. GaNFast power ICs integrate GaN power and drive plus  protection and control circuitry to deliver simple, small, fast and efficient  performance. Over 145 Navitas patents are issued or pending, and over 35 million GaNFast power ICs have been shipped with zero reported  field failures since the firm was  founded in 2014. In exhibition booth #1616, Navitas will feature the latest GaNFast  power IC technology, including the  CES Innovation Award-winning GaNSense technology. Mobile fast and ultra-fast chargers from  Dell, Lenovo, Xiaomi, LG, vivo and many others will be displayed from the more  than 160 in production today, plus new names to be revealed. Beyond chargers,  new hardware will show advances in higher-power applications such as  high-efficiency data-center power and fast-charging EVs. Next-generation  prototype hardware and roadmap technology will be shared with customer partners  under NDA in an adjacent private suite (Marriot Marquis). Throughout the event visitors can experience ultra-fast charging  at the GaNFast Giveaway, with a chance to win GaNFast chargers from sponsors  Spigen, Baseus, UGREEN, Angry Miao  and UIBI, and enter the Navitas 2022 competition to win a Tesla Model 3 Performance, worth over $60,000. Navitas presentations during APEC 2022 are as follows:
