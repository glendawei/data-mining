Vector Photonics appoints Anna O’Dowd as design engineer Photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser (PCSEL)  firm Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow, Scotland, UK has appointed Anna O’Dowd as design engineer, responsible for the simulation  development for the firm’s all-semiconductor PCSEL devices. O’Dowd has a  first-class degree in Physics with Particle Physics  and Cosmology from Lancaster University, where she was the course  representative and physics ambassador. She recently graduated from the  University of Glasgow with an MSc in Nanoscience and Nanotechnoloy. “Anna’s  impressive mathematical, analytical, problem-solving and computational skills  were apparent whilst she worked at Vector Photonics on her University of  Glasgow MSc research project  ‘Simulation of the Band Structure of  PCSELs’,” comments chief technology officer  Dr Richard Taylor. “Now, as a staff  member, we will continue to develop her research expertise, RSoft CAD modeling experience and  nanofabrication lab skills. We also hope her particle physics background will help us develop new levels of  granularity in the simulation of our PCSELs, accelerating our entry into  next-generation datacoms, additive manufacturing and 3D printing markets.” O’Dowd was  previously implementation lead at  Enable International, configuring and implementing DealTrack rebate management software around the world.  This included running the newly opened San Francisco  office.
