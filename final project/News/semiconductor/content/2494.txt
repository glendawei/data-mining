II-VI grows revenue, despite supply-line and COVID-related constraints For its fiscal second-quarter 2022 (ended 31 December 2021), engineered  materials and optoelectronic component maker II-VI Inc of Saxonburg, PA, USA  has reported revenue of $806.8m, up 1.5% on $795.1m last quarter and 2.6% on $786.6m  a year ago. “But for increased supply-line and COVID-related constraints that  accelerated throughout the quarter, we would have cleared the high end of our  revenue guidance [$790-840m],” says chair & CEO Dr Chuck Mattera Jr. By business segment, Photonic Solutions revenue fell from  $536m last quarter to $525m, whereas Compound Semiconductors grew from  $259.1m to $281.8m. Products for the industrial and communications markets led growth  year-on-year. “The two largest drivers of the revenue gaps were from ROADMs and  transceivers,” notes Mattera.
