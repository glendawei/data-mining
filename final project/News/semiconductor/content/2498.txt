CrayoNano establishes branch in Taiwan CrayoNano AS of Trondheim, Norway – which develops  and manufactures semiconductor components based on patented and proprietary  nanomaterials technology – has  expanded its operations and established a branch in Taiwan, located in the city  of Hsinchu (which has a well-established technology infrastructure and  semiconductor community). The first application of CrayoNano’s nanomaterials technology targets the fast-growing disinfection market  with high-quality and performance-driven UV-C ultraviolet short-wavelength light-emitting diodes. “CrayoNano  is entering a global market with our UV-C LED technology,” says CEO Jo Uthus.  “Securing access to the world’s largest market for manufacturing of  semiconductor components is essential for our success. Our Asian operations in  Taiwan will be key going forward.” CrayoNano says that it has learnt from the past 9-12 months of COVID  restrictions and global semiconductor supply-chain constraints that control of  the supply chain and partnering is  an opportunity to leverage the acceleration and commercialization of its UV-C  LED products for disinfection. Seeing the continuation of restrictions at the  start of 2022 validates the acceleration strategy to take stronger control of  the supply chain, reckons CrayoNano. “By establishing in Taiwan, CrayoNano gets access to the talent  and equipment in the region to execute the acceleration of our go-to-market  plan,” says Uthus. “The proximity to supply-chain and R&D partners is  crucial for releasing CrayoNano’s disruptive nanotechnology-based UV-C LED  products and will give us the agility to respond quickly to market changes,” he  reckons. The  CrayoNano Taiwan branch will be established as ‘CrayoNano fab2’ with a dedicated cleanroom  for full nanowire chip development, processing and packaging capabilities,  allowing quick-turn technology transfers to high-volume UV LED foundries. These  additional resources will fast-track the industrialization and customization of  products based on customer and local market requirements. CrayoNano will  leverage existing facilities and manufacturing equipment from its development  partners to shorten the time to become operational and reduce the capital  expenditure (CapEx) requirements. “We are setting aggressive milestones for the CrayoNano fab2 to  become fully operational during this year with quality assurance and testing, order fulfillment and technology  development,” says Uthus. “As we are also extending our ‘Fab 1’ operations in Trondheim, Norway with  staff and equipment, we are positioning for massive scalability and growth in  the next years to come.” CrayoNano’s key Asia-Pacific operations will also include sales,  marketing and technology development.
