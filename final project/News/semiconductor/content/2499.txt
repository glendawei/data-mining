Wise-integration agrees Asian channel partnership with EDOM Wise-integration of Meylan, France, aims to expand business in  Asian markets for its gallium nitride (GaN) power semiconductors  after announcing a new channel partnership with distributor and solutions  provider EDOM Technology of Taipei, Taiwan. The strategic partnership will leverage Wise-integration’s GaN  power transistor and digital control capabilities, as well as EDOM’s  distribution network for semiconductor components and customer-support  capability throughout Asia. Customers should benefit from greater access to GaN products and  resources globally, especially in Asia (one of the fastest-growing markets for  GaN technology). In addition, Wise-integration and EDOM will collaborate on GaN  design using Wise-integration’s WiseGan portfolio of components and WiseWare  digital control AC-DC system architecture software. This should  provide customers with more benefits, including reduced bill of materials  (BOM), easier, faster-design-in, and higher performance due to digital control. “Optimistic about the next-generation materials’ market  potential of wide-bandgap semiconductors as well as the small-size, high-efficiency  GaN technology that Wise-integration provides, we are glad to have  Wise-integration as EDOM’s new partner on expanding our power solutions, and we  will bring more options and advanced solutions to our clients,” comments EDOM’s  chairman Wayne Tseng. “By combining our GaN expertise with EDOM’s capabilities, I am  confident that we will be able to grow our business and help customers realize  more benefits from GaN in their power supply applications,” says Wise-integration’s  CEO Thierry Bouchet.
