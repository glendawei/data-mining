Riber receives order from Arkansas for fifth MBE system Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which designs  and makes  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems and evaporators – has received an order for a Compact 21, 3-inch  research system from professor Greg Salamo, director of Nanoscience and Engineering  Institute at University of Arkansas in the USA. For delivery in 2022,  this fifth Riber MBE system will complete the existing modutrac line.  Apart from III-V nanoscale growths, the new reactor will also allow the study  of epitaxial Si/Ge/Sn/Pb heterostructures focused on band engineering via Sn (tin)  incorporation and strain manipulation. “University of Arkansas Nanoscience and  Engineering Institute is a 25-year-old Riber customer… Their high level of  expertise, understanding and involvement in each discussion and at each step of  the project has been really appreciated by all the Riber project team,” notes Riber’s CEO Philippe  Ley. “The technological issues addressed here  will enhance epitaxy processes and enable Arkansas’ MBE-STM (scanning tunneling microscopy) facility to maintain state-of-the-art results,” he believes. The new system will allow Arkansas  to develop new SiGeSnPb technology not  possible with existing MBE systems, says Salamo. “Through many cycles of  discussion, we arrived at a method to control the temperature of growth at low  temperatures of 100-300°C, which will be tested with emphasis on our requested  specs,” he adds. “As in the past, when we work with Riber to integrate STM,  Riber scientists were amazingly helpful, including modeling different designs,  and we look forward to this and further collaborations with Riber.”
