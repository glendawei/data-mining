Lextar launches UVC LED sterilization solutions Vertically  integrated LED product maker Lextar Electronics Corp of Hsinchu,  Taiwan (a subsidiary of Ennostar Inc) has launched comprehensive UVC LED sterilization  integrated solutions with over 99.9% sterilization efficiency, noting that – since the outbreak  of the COVID-19 pandemic – the demand for sterilization has  surged, and the application of UVC LEDs has become  more diverse. Lextar can offer full-band UVC products  with wavelengths ranging from 255nm to 285nm with different emitting angles to  satisfy various sterilization demands, and these products have been used on  home appliances. For air sterilization, Lextar provides the sterilization  modules in air conditioning which – in combination  with the air outlet system – have been accepted by the top three  Japanese air conditioning/purifier brands and major home appliance manufacturers in EU and USA. The surface sterilization  solution is used by robot vacuum, kitchen and sanitary-ware  manufacturers in Europe. For water sterilization, start-up brands in the  European Union (EU) and the USA have used Lextar’s  UVC module in static sterilization and in faucets in dynamic sterilization to  provide a safer water supply. In addition to being used in consumer  electronic products, Lextar says that its high-power UVC products are also  suitable for crowded places that require long-term bacteriostatic suppression  such as medical or research institutes and public places. The high-power UVC  air-conditioning sterilization module – co-developed with  Future Taiwan Advanced Electronics Pte Ltd – has now been  applied to the negative-pressure wards of Taiwan medical institutions. The  advantages of concentrated light and non-diffusion are beneficial for  increasing sterilization efficiency, which can meet the requirement for a zero  count of colonies detected and clean air while reducing the risk of infection  and improving the quality of hospitalization for patients.
