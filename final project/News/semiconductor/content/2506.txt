Cambridge GaN Devices launches project to develop reliable GaN power ICs for data centers Fabless semiconductor company Cambridge  GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) – which was spun out of the  University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s  Electrical Power and Energy Conversion group in 2016 to develop  power semiconductors using gallium nitride (GaN)-on-silicon  substrates – has launched  ICeData, a project funded by the UK Government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, aiming to develop and commercialize a highly efficient  GaN-based integrated circuit for use  in data-center server power supplies.
