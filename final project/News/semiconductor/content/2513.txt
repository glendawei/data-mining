Luminus launches Smooth White chip-on-board LED arrays Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA, USA – which designs and makes LEDs  and solid-state technology (SST) light sources for illumination markets – has expanded its portfolio of  chip-on-board (COB) arrays with the launch and immediate availability of a new  95CRI-minimum Smooth White COB  series designed for spotlights, downlights, museum, hospitality and  architectural lighting applications. The new LED arrays offer what is claimed  to be excellent uniformity and color over angle consistency, as well as  exceptional long-term color stability. “Luminus  continues to lead the COB industry with a stunning new quality-of-light  solution for low blue, broad-spectrum, directional light sources,” claims David Davito, COB product line director, Illumination, at Luminus.  “Building on our innovative Perfect White  technology, Luminus engineers created an even more natural spectral response  curve to mirror conventional halogen light sources  while optimizing lumen output, vivid  color rendering and human-centric  characteristics,” he adds. “Smooth White  comes without the UV found in competitors’ solutions while establishing a  higher bar for efficacy.”
