Lumentum receives Thailand’s 2021 Prime Minister’s Industry Award in Productivity category Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose, CA, USA (which designs  and makes photonics products for optical networks and lasers for industrial and  consumer markets) says that  Thailand’s prime minister Prayut  Chan-o-cha has presented it with the 2021 Prime Minister’s  Industry Award in the Productivity  category. The award  recognizes Lumentum’s outstanding achievements in successfully integrating  efficiency and effectiveness into its manufacturing processes, emphasizing  continuous improvement at its Thailand facility. Since 1981,  the annual Prime Minister's Industry  Award has honored outstanding enterprises – of any size within any industry –  that have proven business achievements and contributions to the benefit of  Thailand’s society and economy. Award winners are selected based on management  capability, business performance, innovation, technology, economic and social  impact, and corporate governance. “This  recognition demonstrates our ingrained culture of continuous improvement and  our zero-defect mindset,” says Chris Parsons, senior VP of Asia Operations and Services at Lumentum. “We  leverage Kaizen and innovation to drive efficiency through the product  lifecycle, from product concept to the manufacturing processes.” This is the  second major award for Lumentum’s Thailand Navanacorn factory after being presented  with the 2020 Prime Minister award  for Outstanding Achievement in Quality Management. The newly developed site is  the quickest ever to be recognized with this award and in its first attempt.
