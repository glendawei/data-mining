Riber’s full-year 2021 revenue up 3% to €31.2m, as Services & Accessories compensate for restricted export licenses for MBE Systems Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which manufactures  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources and  effusion cells – has reported  full-year revenue up 3%, from €30.2m in 2020 to €31.2m for 2021. Of total  revenue, 31% came from Europe, 59% from Asia, 9% from North America, and 1%  from other regions. Most recently,  revenue in fourth-quarter 2021 was €15.4m, up 21% on €12.7m a year ago and more  than doubling from €6.6m last quarter. Due to the  consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, seasonality increased significantly, with  a focus on the second half of the year, especially for the Systems business. Systems  revenue was down 4% on 2020’s €18.2m to €17.4m for full-year 2021, due to the  French authorities’ refusal to grant several export licenses for orders  amounting to €9m. Eight MBE systems (four production and four research units)  were delivered, compared with 10 in 2020 (four production and six research  units). Revenue for  Services & Accessories rose by 15% from €12m to a record €13.8m (44.2% of  total revenue). Riber says that this  successful strategic development is helping to further strengthen its robust  positions with its R&D and production clients, while also ramping up  recurring revenue across its fleet of machines. Earnings results for full-year  2021 will be released on 13 April, but Riber confirms its forecast  of an operating income of €1.2m. The order book  rose by 3% from €14.4m at end-2000 to €14.8m at end-2021. Specifically,  orders for MBE Systems grew by 39% from €5.7m to €7.9m (including three systems  to be delivered in 2022). This does not include an additional order recorded at  the start of 2022 and three orders pending export licenses. Following the  major deliveries at the end of 2021, orders for Services & Accessories fell  by 21% from €8.7m at the end of 2000, but remained at a good level of €6.9m  end-2021. Riber says that, in a  buoyant semiconductor market, the dynamics of its order intake point to growth  in revenue in 2022.
