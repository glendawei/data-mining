New university in Asia orders Riber MBE 412 system Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which manufactures molecular beam  epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources and  effusion cells – has received an  order for a fully automatic MBE 412 system from newly established university in Asia focusing on engineering  sciences. To be delivered in 2022, the system will be used to  study the magneto-transport effects in gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide  (GaAs/AlGaAs) quantum wells and to grow III-V nanostructures on  silicon with high crystalline perfection. The work and the research programs carried out will be  academic. The MBE 412 system will also be used to develop structures for  prototype MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) micro-pumps, which will be  used in the medical field.
