Power Integrations introduces first automotive-qualified high-voltage switcher ICs with 1700V SiC MOSFET Power  Integrations of San Jose, CA, USA, which provides high-voltage  integrated circuits for energy-efficient power conversion, has added two new  AEC-Q100-qualified, 1700V-rated ICs to its InnoSwitch3-AQ  family.  supply ICs to incorporate a silicon carbide (SiC)  primary switching MOSFET. Delivering up to 70W of output power, the new  ICs are targeted for use in 600V and 800V battery and fuel-cell electric  passenger vehicles, as well as electric buses, trucks and a wide range of  industrial power applications. Highly  integrated InnoSwitch ICs reduce the number of components required to implement  a power supply by as much as 50%, saving significant circuit-board space,  enhancing system reliability and mitigating component sourcing challenges.  Devices from the InnoSwitch family are now available with a choice of  cost-effective silicon, high-efficiency gallium nitride (GaN)  and high-voltage SiC transistors, permitting designers to optimize their power  solution across a broad range of consumer, computer, communications, industrial  and automotive applications. “800V batteries are becoming standard for EVs,” notes Peter Vaughan,  director of automotive business development. “Multiple vehicle systems are  connected to this powerful electrical source, yet delicate electronic control  circuits require just a few volts for operation and communication. InnoSwitch  devices allow the electronics to safely sip from the firehose of energy  available on the main bus, using minimal board area and without wasting energy,” he  adds. “Most exciting is the opportunity to dramatically simplify the emergency  power supply for the  main traction inverter, which  may be called upon at a moment’s notice to operate from any voltage between 30V  and 1000V. Our SiC-based InnoSwitch3-AQ devices handle this vast range with  incredible ease.”
