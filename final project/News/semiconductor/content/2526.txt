Veeco receives multi-tool order from opto component maker Epitaxial deposition and process equipment maker Veeco Instruments Inc  of Plainview, NY, USA says that a leading manufacturer of optoelectronic  components has ordered multiple Lumina metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) systems for the production of optoelectronic components for photonics  applications. The customer currently operates multiple Veeco MOCVD platforms,  as well as other Veeco technologies. “Following a  successful evaluation, the superior performance of the Lumina platform has now  been fully validated with several follow-on-orders for use in high-volume  manufacturing,” says Adrian Devasahayam Ph.D., Veeco’s senior VP,  product management. “The Lumina system is built on over 20 years of  high-volume MOCVD expertise and carries on the proven performance of our core  TurboDisc technology,” he adds. “To enable advanced photonics devices, leading  companies depend on superior film quality, exceptional uniformity,  repeatability and low defectivity with unmatched cost of ownership  that Lumina delivers.” At the heart  of the Lumina system is Veeco’s MOCVD TurboDisc technology, which features what  is claimed to be excellent uniformity and low defectivity over long campaigns  for exceptional yield and flexibility. In addition, Veeco’s proprietary  technology drives uniform injection and thermal control for thickness and  compositional uniformity. Providing a seamless wafer size transition, the  system is capable of depositing high-quality arsenic phosphide (As/P)  epitaxial layers on wafers up to 8-inches in diameter. The Lumina system allows  users to customize their systems for maximum value in delivering micro-LEDs,  LEDs, edge-emitting lasers and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs)  in high-volume production, says Veeco.
