EPC releases Phase 14 report on GaN reliability Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA –  which makes enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power  field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for power management  applications – has announced  its Phase-14 Reliability Report, documenting the strategy used to achieve a its field reliability record. The rapid adoption of  GaN devices in many diverse applications calls for the continued accumulation  of reliability statistics and research into the fundamental physics of failure  in GaN devices, the firm says. The Phase-14  Reliability Report presents the strategy used to  measure and predict lifetime based on tests that force devices to fail under a  variety of conditions. This information can be used to create stronger and  higher-performance products for applications such as light detection &  ranging (LiDAR) for autonomous cars, robotics,  security and drones, high-power-density  computing, and satellites. The report presents the results of testing  eGaN devices to the point of failure, which provides the information to  identify intrinsic failure mechanisms of the devices. By identifying these,  deep knowledge of the behavior of a device over time, temperature, electrical  or mechanical stress can be developed and used to create physics-based models  that accurately project the safe operating life of a product over a more general  set of operating conditions. The report is divided into eight sections,  each dealing with a different failure mechanism: “The release of EPC’s Phase-14 Reliability  Report represents the cumulative experience of millions of devices and five  generations of technology to lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of  GaN devices over a wide range of stress conditions,” notes CEO & co-founder  Dr Alex Lidow.
