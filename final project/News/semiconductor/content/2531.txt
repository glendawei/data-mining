PCSEL firm Vector Photonics appoints process engineer Photonic-crystal  surface-emitting laser (PCSEL) firm Vector Photonics Ltd of Glasgow,  Scotland, UK has appointed Dr Joao Valente as process engineer, bringing extensive knowledge of  the micro- and nano-fabrication of optoelectronic devices to the company. Picture:      Vector  Photonics’ new process engineer Dr Joao Valente. “Dr Valente is both a material scientist and  engineer, with outstanding experience and expertise in semiconductor device  fabrication and characterization,” comments Dr David  Childs, director of product development.  “This unique skill set has led to  his involvement in the development of many innovative, epitaxial growth and  silicon substrate nanofabrication concepts, at the cutting edge of  semiconductor device manufacture. He will help Vector Photonics develop high-yield processes and high-performance  devices, as we continue to commercialize our PCSEL technology during 2022.” Joao most  recently held research assistant  roles at the University of Glasgow, James Watt  Nanofabrication Center; University College  London, Electronic and Electric Department; and the University of Southampton,  Optoelectronics Research Centre;  advancing photonic nano-fabrication and characterization performance. Joao’s PhD, from  the University of Southampton, titled ‘Controlling Light with Plasmonic  Metasurfaces’, led to several breakthroughs in the coherent control of light  and demonstrated a new magneto-electro-optical effect in reconfigurable  plasmonic metamaterials. His European Masters in Material Science and  Engineering, improved understanding of production techniques in high-dielectric  thin films, and his degree from the  Universidade Nova de Lisboa, focused on the optimization of TCO films for  microelectronic devices.
