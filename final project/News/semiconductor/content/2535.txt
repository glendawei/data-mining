Apple iPhone tops smartphone market in Q4/2021, but Samsung remains top for full year Global smartphone shipments fell by 2.7%  year-on-year to 365 million units in fourth-quarter 2021, according to  market research firm Strategy Analytics. “Factory constraints and component shortages continued to  restrict smartphone supply in the final quarter of last year,” notes senior director Linda Sui. Despite this, full-year smartphone shipments still rose by 4.5% year-on-year to 1.36 billion units in 2021,  recovering from a sharp Covid-led decline of -8% year-on-year during 2020.  Picture:   Global smartphone  shipments and market share in Q4/2021 and full-year 2021. Apple iPhone topped the global  smartphone market with a 22% share in Q4/2021, shipping 80 million  units. “Demand was strong for  the new iPhone 13 series in  China and other markets,” notes Woody Oh,  director at Strategy Analytics. However, for full-year 2021, Apple remained in second place (with 16.8%  market share), as Samsung maintained  first place (with 20% market share). Samsung shipped 69 million  smartphones, up 12.4% year-on-year,  for 18.9% market share in  Q4/2021. “Samsung had a good quarter, led by its innovative Flip and Fold 5G models.  Samsung grew faster than all its major rivals,” he adds. Samsung ramped up  volumes in North and South America amid the withdrawal of LG, but the  competition in Asia remained fierce. Xiaomi shipped 45 million  smartphones and took third place with 12.3% global market share in Q4/2021, up slightly  from 11% a year ago. “Xiaomi benefitted from the withdrawal of Huawei and LG  and expanded its retail footprint into all major regions last year,” says senior analyst Yiwen Wu. OPPO (OnePlus) held fourth spot and captured 9.4% global market share in Q4/2021. Vivo stayed  fifth with 7.8% market share  in Q4/2021. However, OPPO (OnePlus) and Vivo both lost ground, as 5G  competition from Honor and other smartphone competitors intensified sharply at  home in China.” “Global competition among other major smartphone brands, beyond  the top-five, was fierce during Q4/2021,” notes Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics.  “Honor, Lenovo-Motorola, Realme and Transsion all outperformed the overall  market and posted double-digit growth rates. Honor continued to soar in China.  Lenovo-Motorola gained share from LG in the Americas. Realme had a very strong  quarter in India, China and elsewhere. Transsion held firm across the Africa  region,” he adds. “We forecast global smartphone shipments to grow a mild +3% year-on-year in full-year 2022,” says senior director Linda Sui. “This year will be a tale  of two halves. Component shortages, price inflation and Covid uncertainty will  continue to weigh on the smartphone market during the first half of 2022,  before the situation eases in the second half due to Covid vaccines, interest  rate rises by central banks, and less supply disruption at factories.”
