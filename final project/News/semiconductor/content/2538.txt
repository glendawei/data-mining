Greenworks chooses GaN Systems for charging station GaN Systems Inc of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (a  fabless developer of gallium nitride-based power switching  semiconductors for power conversion and control applications) says that its power  transistors are featured in the 24V Cordless Stick Vacuum super charging station of Greenworks,  a provider of battery-operated power equipment that aims to make sustainable,  eco-friendly products designed to deliver high performance with the lowest  environmental impact. The collaboration is said to underscore the  trend towards USB charging becoming the ubiquitous solution for charging consumer,  household and industrial products. Greenworks says that incorporating a  multi-port USB charger into its  charging station improves the  convenience of charging everyday products and helps to reduce the need for  additional chargers. GaN Systems says that it is delivers the fast  charging and small form factors needed for Greenworks’ charging station. Specifically,  the super charging station  offers fast-charging of multiple devices in a single charge location: GaN Systems says that its transistors and  reference designs meet consumer and industrial market charger requirements. GaN chargers are  reckoned to be up to 4x smaller than conventional chargers and meet the  fast-charging needs of today’s devices. “GaN is becoming the universal choice  for chargers and adapters beyond smartphone and computing products,” says GaN Systems’ CEO Jim  Witham. “It’s great to see USB charging expand into more and more adjacent  markets.”
