Toshiba launches 1200V and 1700V SiC MOSFET modules Tokyo-based Toshiba Electronic Devices &  Storage Corp (TDSC) - spun off from Toshiba Corp in 2017 - has launched two silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET dual modules: MG600Q2YMS3 with a voltage  rating of 1200V and drain current  rating of 600A, and MG400V2YMS3 with a voltage rating of 1700V and drain current rating of 400A. The first Toshiba  products with these voltage ratings, they join the previously released  MG800FXF2YMS3 in a lineup of 1200V, 1700V and 3300V devices. The new modules (in a 2-153A1A package) have mounting  compatibility with widely used silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)  modules. Their low-energy-loss  characteristics meet needs for higher efficiency and size reductions in  industrial equipment, such as converters and inverters for railway vehicles,  and renewable energy power generation systems, says the firm. Applications  include: inverters and  converters for railway vehicles; renewable energy  power generation systems; motor control equipment; and high-frequency  DC-DC converter.
