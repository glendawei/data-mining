EPC launches 2kW, two-phase 48V/14V bidirectional converter with regulated output voltage reference design board Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El  Segundo, CA, USA – which makes enhancement-mode  gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power  field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for  power management applications – has announced the availability of the EPC9170,  a 2kW, two-phase 48V–14V bidirectional converter that operates with 96.8% peak  efficiency in a small footprint. The board features the ePower 100V, 65A  integrated circuit chipset. The  chipset includes the EPC23101 eGaN IC plus EPC2302 eGaN FET for a solution capable of a maximum withstand  voltage of 100V, delivering up to 65A load current,  while capable of switching speeds  greater than 1MHz. The fast-switching speed and low losses of the gallium nitride (GaN) devices allow the converter  to operate at 500kHz, which significantly reduces the size of the solution, and  exceeds 96.5% efficiency between 60A and 110A with 95.8% efficiency at 140A.
