ACM strengthens wet processing portfolio with new compound semiconductor tools ACM Research Inc (ACM) of Fremont, CA, USA, which develops and manufactures wafer processing solutions for semiconductor and advanced wafer-level packaging (WLP) applications, has introduced its comprehensive tool set to support compound semiconductor manufacturing. The 150–200mm bridge systems support front-end cleaning and a wide range of WLP applications for compound semiconductors including gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) processes. The wet process portfolio includes coater, developer, photoresist (PR) stripper, wet etcher, cleaner and metal plating tools that feature automated systems for flat or notched wafers. “The compound semiconductor industry is growing rapidly, with demand increasing across a variety of end markets,” says president & CEO Dr David Wang. “ACM has leveraged its expertise and technology in  front-end and WLP tool sets to deliver high-performance and cost-effective  systems to address the specific technology requirements of compound semiconductors.  We believe the market for compound semiconductor capital equipment offers significant growth opportunities to ACM, as GaAs, GaN and SiC devices are becoming an increasingly integral part of future electric vehicle (EV), 5G communication system and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.” ACM’s compound semiconductor capital equipment portfolio includes the following:
