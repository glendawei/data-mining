Ushio ships samples of 1.2W 675nm and 690nm red multi-mode laser diodes Ushio Inc has begun shipping samples of its new HL67203HD and  HL69203HD multi-mode laser diodes (LDs),  which present improvements to output power (1.2W cw) and efficiency (40% and 41%, respectively)  over the conventional 675nm and 690nm red laser light sources commonly used in medical,  healthcare and life science  fields. Designed by Ushio’s engineers in Japan, the new 9mm CAN-packaged red laser diodes can induce highly efficient and  short-lived photochemical reactions with substances and reagents, found in the  human body, which absorb light in the 670–690nm wavelength range. These  absorption characteristics enable red laser diodes to function in many medical and healthcare applications,  such as photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment, as well as acne or blemish  treatment. Furthermore, operating over a  temperature range of –10°C to +75°C,  the HL67203HD and HL69203HD are promising for practical life science analytics, such as Raman  spectroscopy and confocal microscopy. In particular, high-power,  high-efficiency 690nm red laser diodes,  coupled with fiber, have been the subject of increasing interest for  photo-immunotherapy, which has been attracting attention in recent years as a  ‘fifth cancer treatment’. Ushio has been offering the HL67001DG (675nm, 200mW) and HL69001DG  (690nm, 200mW) single-mode laser diodes to these markets but, to meet their evolving demands,  Ushio’s solid-state lighting (SSL) division set to work extending the lasing  wavelength range. This was achieved by applying the same high-power,  high-efficiency and high-reliability technologies that were developed for laser  products in the 640nm and 660nm bands. With the new HL67203HD and HL69203HD products, Ushio says that it  aims to meet customers’ needs in a wider range of applications, such as the  realization of quality of life (QOL) in the life science field.
