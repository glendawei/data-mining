Lextar supplies first high-volume AEC-Q102-qualified VCSELs to automakers For expanding time-of-flight (ToF)  three-dimensional (3D) applications, Lextar Electronics of  Hsinchu, Taiwan (a subsidiary of Ennostar group) passed the strict AEC-Q102  standard and went into mass production before other companies (it is claimed)  in 2020, and started to supply high-quality vertical-cavity surface-emitting  lasers (VCSELs) to automakers in the European Union (EU) and USA  in 2021. Lextar says that its high-efficiency  PV88Q-series VCSELs have extremely high environmental resistance (from -40°C to  125°C), can be operated without active cooling, and meet  strict automotive environmental standards. The special optical design provides a  field of view (FoV) of 45–120° to meet the  differing product design needs of customers. In particular, the VCSELs are  especially suitable for in-cabin driving monitoring systems  (DMS), advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and 3D  gesture recognition applications in the car  center control, helping drivers by improving driving safety. “The PV88Q VCSEL product has passed the  vehicle regulation certification and has been mass produced; now, we have successfully delivered to EU and USA automakers,  which symbolizes that Lextar’s product design and  manufacturing technology in high-end laser packaging has entered a new  milestone, also proving Lextar’s capability to provide efficient and reliable  sensing components for the intelligent driving monitoring system  in the car,” says Mitch Lee, deputy general manager of the  Lextar Electronics business group. Lextar reckons that, in the future, its  high-end laser sensing products will play a key role in the supply chain of new-generation vehicles.
