Navitas participating at Baird’s 2022 Vehicle Technology & Mobility Conference Gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit  firm Navitas Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland is  participating at Baird’s Vehicle Technology & Mobility Conference being  held virtually on 25 January at 2:55pm EST (hosted  by the Baird’s Equity Research and Global  Investment Banking teams). Compared with legacy silicon solutions, GaN-based on-board  chargers (OBCs) are estimated to charge 3x faster with up to 70% energy  savings. GaN OBCs, DC-DC converters and traction inverters are estimated to  extend electric vehicle (EV) range  or reduce battery costs by 5%, and  to accelerate adoption of EVs worldwide by three years.  Navitas will highlight how efficiency and cost improvements offered by GaN  allow EV manufacturers to address the key challenges of reducing charging time,  increasing energy savings, lowering  price and extending range.
