EPISTAR develops record-output SWIR LEDs EPISTAR of Hsinchu,  Taiwan (a subsidiary of Ennostar Inc) says that, after investing resources  in recent years on developing short-wavelength-infrared LED chips (SWIR,  wavelength >1100nm) – which have since been certified under related  regulations and introduced in various customers’ wearable health detection  devices – the optical power of its 1300nm product has now reached 25mW (28%  higher than others, making it the highest-output SWIR LED in the world, it is  claimed). With the rising awareness of public  health, the application sector is more diverse and the demand for physiological  data detection (bio-sensing) has increased sharply, notes the firm. Besides  common applications such as the detection of heart rate and blood oxygen, more applications with non-intrusive detection  are being developed, such as skin moisture  detection, blood glucose and blood lipids. Short-wavelength infrared LED chips  with wavelengths above 1100nm are required for the detection of these specific  physiological applications. The efficiency and reliability of LED  chips are key to the success of health or medical products, so EPISTAR Lab uses indium phosphide (InP) as the substrate to  develop the highest-output short-wavelength-infrared LED chips with highly  efficient emitting power and high reliability under low voltage. Due to the development of short-wavelength-infrared LED technology, a  variety of applications with non-invasive health detection  beneficial to various users will be launched on the market in the near future,  says the firm.
