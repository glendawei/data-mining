Navitas’ GaN IC powering vivo’s iQOO 9 Pro smartphone Gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuit firm Navitas  Semiconductor of El Segundo, CA, USA and Dublin, Ireland says that  its GaNFast power IC is driving the 120W ultra-fast charger supplied  ‘in-box’ with the iQOO-brand flagship iQOO 9 Pro mobile phone of  China-based vivo. The 9 Pro’s 4700mAhr battery charges from 0-100% in only  19 minutes. Also, at only 60.5mm x 52.5mm x 28.8mm  (92cc), the charger is 26% smaller than the previous generation, reaching  1.3W/cc power density. Weighing just 135g, the iQOO 120W GaNFast charger  is similar in size and weight to regular 65W chargers. Founded in  2014, Navitas introduced what it claimed to be the first commercial GaN power  integrated circuits. Its proprietary GaNFast power ICs monolithically  integrate GaN power field-effect transistors (FETs) and GaN drive plus  control and protection circuits in a single SMT package. Since GaN is reckoned  to run up to 20x faster than silicon, GaNFast power ICs are said to  deliver up to 3x faster charging or 3x more power in half the size and weight.  Over 30 million GaNFast power ICs have been shipped with zero reported  field failures.
