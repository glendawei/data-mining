Nippon Sanso and NCSU collaborating on GaN epitaxy and device technology Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp (TNSC) of Tokyo, Japan and North Carolina  State University (NC State) have  announced a three-year agreement to collaborate on methods and equipment  solutions to enable gallium nitride  (GaN)-based optoelectronic, photonic and electronic devices. NC State will use a TNSC SR2000  metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) reactor for its R&D, with support and expertise from  TNSC. The goal of the three-year collaboration is to advance the  state-of-the-art in GaN-based device epitaxy and device technology with a blend  of complementary equipment, process and device expertise. “NC State has  an excellent reputation for wide-bandgap device and technology development and  commercialization,” comments TNSC corporate officer  Kunihiro Kobayashi. “Taiyo Nippon Sanso  is looking forward to working with professor Fred Kish, the NC State staff and students, and outside  companies that work with the NC State  Nanofabrication Facility.” As applications for GaN lasers and LEDs continue to  expand, TNSC expects its SR and UR MOCVD platforms to be the platforms of choice  for advanced GaN optoelectronics fabrication. “With the  addition of the TNSC MOCVD system, NC State  is now one of the very few research institutions with this state-of-the-art  materials growth capability,” says Fred Kish, the M.C.  Dean Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer  Engineering and director of the NC State  Nanofabrication Facility. “The collaboration with TNSC will significantly  impact advances in the realization of next-generation wide-bandgap and  ultrawide-bandgap materials and devices,” he reckons.
