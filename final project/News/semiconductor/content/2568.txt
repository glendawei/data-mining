EPC Space provides demo boards for evaluating rad-hard GaN power devices EPC Space LLC of Haverhill, MA, USA has announced the availability of a family of demonstration  boards to help designers quickly and easily implement radiation-hardened (RH)  gallium nitride (GaN) power devices into their high-reliability and  aerospace applications. The new family  of demonstration boards offers fast prototyping and evaluation of the features  and capabilities of EPC Space’s rad-hard eGaN power devices. The  offering includes the following: (1) a trio of low-side driver demo boards  (EPC7C001, EPC7C002, EPC7C003), which utilize EPC Space’s eGaN gate driver  modules to drive a corresponding 40V, 100V or 200V discrete eGaN FET; (2) the  EPC7C005 demo board, which allows evaluation of the switching operation and  conversion efficiency performance of the FBS-GAM02-P-C50 rad-hard power module  connected as a half-bridge point-of-load (POL) output stage; and (3) the  EPC7C006 demo board, which is a three-phase motor demonstration board that  utilizes the FBS-GAM02-P-R50 module. “Radiation-hardened  eGaN FETs and ICs offer designers improved performance, lower cost and shorter  delivery times compared to RH silicon-based devices,” says CEO Bel Lazar. “We  are happy to provide an easy-to-use evaluation platform to assist designers  looking to convert their RH silicon designs to take advantage of the higher  power densities, higher efficiencies, and better cost and delivery that  GaN offers.” Five-unit  pricing starts at $850/each with lead times of six-weeks.
