Ohmic contacts on lightly doped p-GaN Nagoya University in Japan reports improved  Ohmic behavior for contacts on p-type gallium nitride (p-GaN) through using an  annealed and treated magnesium layer [Shun Lu et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v119,  p242104, 2021]. The team comments: “Compared with other conventional methods  such as continuous growing or regrowth, our process requires a lower  temperature and pressure and can achieve a localized contact layer easily  without any etching-induced damage.” The researchers see benefits for a range of  power electronics applications using components such as  metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) or heterojunction  bipolar transistors (HBTs), where low-resistance Ohmic contacts are essential  for effective operation. GaN is favored for power electronics due to high  breakdown electrical field, high saturated electron velocity, and high electron  mobility. Good contacts with n-GaN are relatively easy to achieve with titanium  and gold.
