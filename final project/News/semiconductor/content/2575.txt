k-Space achieves record annual thin-film metrology sales k-Space  Associates Inc of Dexter, MI, USA – which produces thin-film metrology  instrumentation and software for research and manufacturing of microelectronic,  optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices – says that it increased its 2021  thin-film metrology sales by 30% compared with 2020, making it a record sales  year. This increase was due partly to robust sales of the kSA MOS UltraScan. The kSA MOS UltraScan ex-situ metrology tool is a high-resolution scanning system that  measures wafer curvature, bow and tilt. Based on proven and patented  kSA MOS technology, UltraScan uses a laser array to map the two-dimensional  curvature, wafer bow and stress of reflective surfaces such as  semiconductor wafers, optical mirrors, glass and lenses. This technology is  also available in the kSA ThermalScan model, which includes an integrated  heating chamber for thermal stress analysis of wafers. “k-Space has built a reputation for  designing and producing superior metrology tools that have varying applications  in both research and manufacturing settings,” says CEO Darryl Barlett. “And  with the ability to customize any k-Space tool to fit each customer’s specific  requirements, our customers know that their instruments will help them  accomplish their research and production goals. That’s why so many of our  customers come back to us when they have additional specialized metrology needs,”  he adds.
