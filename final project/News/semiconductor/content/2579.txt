A*STAR’s IME and Soitec to co-develop silicon carbide for EVs and high-voltage electronics The Institute of Microelectronics (IME) at Singapore’s Agency for  Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and engineered substrate  manufacturer Soitec of Bernin, near Grenoble, France have announced a  research collaboration to develop silicon carbide (SiC) devices to power  electric vehicles (EVs) and advanced high-voltage electronic devices.  Specifically, Soitec’s proprietary technologies such as Smart Cut and  IME’s pilot production line will be leveraged to create 200mm-diameter SiC  substrates. The joint  research aims to contribute towards developing a holistic SiC ecosystem and  boosting semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in Singapore and the region.  The research collaboration is planned to run until mid-2024, and aims to  achieve the following outcomes: “This joint  research between A*STAR’s Institute of Microelectronics and Soitec to develop  next-generation semiconductor devices using innovative technologies is made  possible by both organizations’ deep capabilities in R&D,” says IME’s  executive director Terence Gan. “We look forward to working together with  Soitec to add value to the local R&D ecosystem and the growing pool of  silicon carbide players in the semiconductor industry,” he adds. “This is a  great opportunity for us to partner with Singapore’s Institute of  Microelectronics and demonstrate SmartSiC substrate’s scalability to 200mm,”  says Christophe Maleville, chief technology officer & senior executive VP  at Soitec. “The collaboration paves the way for the development of advanced  epitaxy solutions to produce higher-quality SiC wafers with energy-efficient  characteristics, given the exciting potential of this material. As the main  beneficiaries of this new process, the semiconductor ecosystem in Singapore  will be given the opportunity to validate the superior energy efficiency  of the SiC wafers produced through our collaboration.”
