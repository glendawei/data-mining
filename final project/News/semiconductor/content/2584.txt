Qorvo launches first single FEM to support 5.1-7.1GHz bands Qorvo Inc of Greensboro, NC, USA (which provides  core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and defense  applications) has introduced  the first wideband Wi-Fi front-end module (FEM) covering the 5.1-7.1GHz  bands for customer premises equipment (CPE). The new wideband QPF4730 can  provide full-frequency support for both Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E  enterprise solutions. In previous generations of Wi-Fi routers, each radio is fixed to a  specific frequency, due to the narrowband nature of available solutions. To  enable broadband operation, manufacturers must currently place a 5GHz front-end module,  a 6GHz front-end module and switch components. The QPF4730 flexibly  delivers full high-band support while reducing the board space required in  Wi-Fi 6E upgrades. This improves overall system performance, capacity and  flexibility, says the firm. “Qorvo’s newest FEM is optimized to operate over 5GHz, 6GHz or  both, to maximize system capacity and throughput, which is not possible in  existing CPE designs,” says Tony Testa, director of technical marketing.  “Qorvo’s QPF4730 is the first in a family of new products that will address  operational and architectural flexibility for Wi-Fi 6E channels and will  include solutions for home gateways, routers and mesh systems.” The QPF4730 enhances efficiency in Wi-Fi 6/Wi-Fi 6E  architectures and is optimized for Power over Ethernet (PoE),  improving Quality of Service (QoS), range and throughput. The  solution maximizes user capacity and leverages the full available spectrum. It  also enables manufacturers to design smaller form factors than current  gateways to meet user expectations for more compact, sleek and efficient  designs. With its expanded spectrum, Wi-Fi 6E provides higher throughput  while servicing more client connections in home, campus and enterprise  settings, say Qorvo.
