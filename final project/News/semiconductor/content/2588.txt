Kyocera SLD Laser achieves record LiFi communications data rate 100 times faster than 5G Kyocera SLD Laser Inc (KSLD) of  Goleta, near Santa Barbara, CA, USA,  which is commercializing gallium nitride (GaN)-based laser light sources  for automotive, mobility, specialty lighting and consumer applications, says  that it has achieved what is claimed to be the fastest LiFi system that delivers a data rate of greater than  90Gbps (100 times faster than 5G). The firm is demonstrating the DataLight innovation for automotive  and consumer applications at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2022)  in Las Vegas (5–7 January). “To pioneer the future of lighting and wireless connectivity, our  ultra-high-speed LiFi technology is eye-safe, impervious to ambient lighting,  secure, efficient and RF-free,” says Kyocera SLD Laser’s CEO Dr James  Raring. “KSLD is commercializing LiFi solutions for customers in mobility  applications, automotive and undersea, as well as RF-sensitive environments  such as airplane cabins, smart factories, healthcare, secure government  facilities and smart cities.” KSLD’s DataLight LiFi innovation utilizes its dual-emission  visible and infrared LaserLight sources, which enable customers to  commercialize potent intelligent illumination systems including functionality  of spatially dynamic lighting, night-vision illumination, accurate sensing and  3D LiDAR, as well as optical power transmission. DataLight engines can be  configured for customer-specific applications and have the potential to be  performance optimized using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine  learning. Kyocera SLD Laser is hosting meetings both in person at CES 2022 (in  West Hall exhibition booth 3423) and virtually (by appointment).
