EPC introduces 12V–48V 500W GaN boost converter demo board with same BOM size as silicon Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC) of El Segundo, CA, USA –  which makes enhancement-mode gallium nitride on silicon (eGaN) power  field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated circuits for  power management applications – has announced the availability of the EPC9166,  a 500W DC-DC demonstration board that converts a 12V input to 48V output. The  EPC9166 demonstrates the Renesas ISL81807 80V two-phase synchronous boost  controller with the latest-generation EPC2218  eGaN FETs to achieve greater than 96.5% efficiency in a 12V input to 48V regulated output conversion with 500kHz switching frequency. The output voltage can be  configured to 36V, 48V and 60V. The board can deliver 480W power without a  heatsink. Regulated  DC-DC boost converters are widely used in data-center,  computing and automotive applications, converting a  nominal 12V to a 48V distribution bus among other output voltages. The main  trend has been towards higher power density. EPC says that eGaN FETs provide the fast switching, high efficiency and  small size that can meet the stringent power density  requirements of these leading-edge applications. EPC2218 is claimed to be the  smallest and highest-efficiency 100V FET in the market. The ISL81807 is the first 80V  dual-output/two-phase (single output)  synchronous buck controller with integrated  GaN driver, supporting frequencies  up to 2MHz. The ISL81807 uses current mode  control and generates two independent outputs or one output with two  interleaved phases. It supports current sharing, synchronization for  paralleling more controllers/more phases, enhanced light load efficiency and  low shutdown current. ISL81807  directly drives EPC GaN FETs,  ensuring easy design, low component count and  solution cost, says EPC.  “The Renesas  controller IC makes using GaN even easier,” comments EPC’s CEO Alex Lidow. “We  are delighted to work with Renesas to combine the benefits of their advanced  controllers with the performance of GaN to provide customers with a  low-component-count solution that increases efficiency, increases power density,  and reduces system cost,” he adds. “The Renesas  ISL81807 is designed to fully exploit the high performance of GaN FETs for high-power-density solutions,”  says Andrew Cowell, VP of the  Mobility, Industrial and Infrastructure Power Division at Renesas. “ISL81807  reduces BOM cost for GaN solutions because it does not require an MCU, current sense op amp,  external driver or bias power. It is  also fully protected and integrates the GaN drivers. With the ISL81807,  designing with GaN FETs is as simple as designing with silicon-based FETs,” he  adds. The EPC9166  demonstration board from EPC is priced $300 each and is available for immediate  delivery from distributor Digi-Key Corp.
