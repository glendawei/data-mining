New Assessment Identifies Opportunities for Strengthening India’s Role in Semiconductor Ecosystem by Rina Pal-Goetzen, Director of Global PolicySIA has long supported efforts to strengthen U.S.-India collaboration in the semiconductor supply chain. A new initial assessment—commissioned by SIA and the India Electronics Semiconductor Association (IESA) and authored by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF)—finds that India brings significant strengths to the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem.The U.S. and India ramped up cooperation in the semiconductor ecosystem in January, with an agreement to expand strategic technology partnerships and defense industrial cooperation between the nations’ businesses, academic institutions, and government agencies. As part of this effort, called the initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), SIA and IESA agreed to undertake a “readiness assessment” to identify near-term industry opportunities and facilitate the longer-term strategic development of the nations’ complementary semiconductor ecosystems. SIA and IESA commissioned ITIF, a Washington-based science and technology policy think tank, to author this assessment, and in May 2023 an ITIF representative undertook a fact-finding trip to India for this purpose. ITIF today released the executive summary of the assessment, on the occasion of Prime Minister Modi’s state visit to Washington, DC.India and the United States have an opportunity to learn from one another as they seek to strengthen the competitiveness of their semiconductor sectors and deepen their partnerships in global semiconductor supply chains. To this end:ITIF’s final report will explore all these topics in greater detail and will be delivered this fall.SIA looks forward to continued engagement and partnership with the governments of the U.S. and India as they craft a policy framework for collaboration in the semiconductor ecosystem.
