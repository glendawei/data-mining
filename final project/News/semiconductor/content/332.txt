Prosecutors have alleged that Choi, a former Samsung Electronics executive and a South Korean chip expert, stole sensitive information developed by the world’s top memory chipmaker. The high-profile criminal case against Choi, an award-winning engineer once seen as a star in South Korea’s chip industry, highlights Seoul’s efforts to crack down on industrial espionage and slow China’s progress in chip manufacturing. Choi, now in custody in Suwon, a city south of Seoul where Samsung has its headquarters, attended the hearing in his beige prison uniform and denied all the charges.

Choi briefly said “yes” when asked by a judge whether he agreed with his lawyer. Prosecutors have also charged five former employees at Choi’s chip consultancy firm, Jin Semiconductor, and a former employee at a Samsung contractor. In a letter from prison last month, Choi rejected allegations he had sought to build a copycat chip factory in China with information illegally obtained via Samsung’s supplier network. Samsung representatives were not immediately available for comment.
