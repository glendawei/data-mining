SIA Welcomes Commerce Department Action to Advance National Semiconductor Technology Center by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—April 25, 2023—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today released the following statement from SIA President and CEO John Neuffer welcoming the Commerce Department’s release of a white paper advancing implementation of the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), an entity established by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to promote semiconductor research and development.“Today’s action represents a valuable step forward for implementation of the National Semiconductor Technology Center, a cornerstone of the landmark CHIPS and Science Act signed into law last year. While we are still reviewing the details set forth in the Commerce Department’s white paper, we are encouraged it reflects industry leaders’ input and recommendations, including those outlined in SIA’s recent report on semiconductor research. We look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Raimondo, others in the Commerce Department, and the future leadership of the NSTC itself to ensure the new law is implemented in a way that maximizes its return on investment and turbocharges U.S. semiconductor production and innovation for many years to come.”Companies in the semiconductor ecosystem have announced dozens of new projects across America since the CHIPS Act was introduced. These announced projects will total hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments and support hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs. The CHIPS Act’s manufacturing grants and substantial investments in semiconductor research will help reinvigorate the U.S. economy and reinforce America’s national security and critical supply chains.# # #
