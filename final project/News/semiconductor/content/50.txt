SIA Welcomes Secretary Raimondo’s Commitment to Swift, Effective Implementation of CHIPS and Science Act by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—Feb. 23, 2023—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) released the following statement from SIA President and CEO John Neuffer regarding U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s remarks today on implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act.“Secretary Raimondo has been a tireless advocate for the CHIPS and Science Act, the historic new law that will reinvigorate chip production and innovation in America. Since the CHIPS Act was introduced, companies in the semiconductor ecosystem have announced new projects across America totaling hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments and supporting hundreds of thousands of new jobs. These new projects—combined with the new law’s critical investments in semiconductor research—will help strengthen America’s economy, national security, critical supply chains, and leadership in the semiconductor-driven technologies of today and tomorrow.“As the Secretary highlighted today, we must now ensure the CHIPS Act is implemented efficiently, effectively, and expeditiously. We share her ambitious vision that CHIPS implementation provides an historic opportunity to ‘unite behind a shared objective … and think boldly and think big.’ We look forward to working with Secretary Raimondo and other leaders in the Administration to advance the CHIPS Act’s goals of strengthening our economy and national security and making our supply chains more resilient.”# # #
