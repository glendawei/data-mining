Export orders are estimated to have fallen by over 25% from a year earlier, according to forecasts by 15 economists. Taiwan’s export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, fell by a worse-than-expected 23.4% in November.  The government last month predicted December’s export orders would be between 27.8% and 30.8% lower than those reported a year earlier. Taiwan’s export orders are a leading indicator of demand for high-tech gadgets and Asian exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months. The island’s manufacturers, including the world’s largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc.
