SIA Applauds Increased Funding for Research, Workforce Development in Year-End Funding Package by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—Dec. 21, 2022—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today released the following statement from David Isaacs, SIA vice president of government affairs, regarding the inclusion of additional funding for key research agencies in the fiscal year 2023 (FY2023) Omnibus. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.“Building off the important investments made by the CHIPS and Science Act, SIA applauds increased funding for research and workforce development in the FY2023 Omnibus. Once passed, these investments will help advance innovation, strengthen the American STEM workforce, promote economic growth, and maintain national security by reinforcing the National Science Foundation (NSF), regional technology hubs, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) manufacturing programs. While the funding is below the authorization levels in the CHIPS and Science Act, it nonetheless represents a positive step in enhancing the U.S. research enterprise and workforce development. We look forward to working with the new Congress and the administration next year to further prioritize American science and technology leadership for the future.”# # #
