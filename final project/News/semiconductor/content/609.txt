Taiwan said on Saturday that it is set to win $940 million in new microchip investment after meetings with four major tech firms in California’s Silicon Valley. Economy minister Wang Mei-hua met with executives at Cisco Systems Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Applied Materials Inc and Synopsys Inc on Friday, adding that she was met by “great interest.”   Taiwan is a major semiconductor producer, home to the world’s largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, and supplies most the world’s major tech firms. Wang Mei-hua has been in the United States all week to respond to what her office has called “concerns” about supply chains and geopolitical issues. China Pressure The island’s position as a producer has prompted worries in the United States it is too reliant on Taiwan, especially as China ramps up military drills to assert its sovereignty claims. The ministry said Wang met with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson, Cisco senior vice president and global innovation officer Guy Diedrich, and Synopsys chairman and CEO Aart de Geus. NVIDIA declined to comment on the meeting. The other three companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wang said on Tuesday that if Taiwan remains safe, global supply chains of vital semiconductors would also be secure.
