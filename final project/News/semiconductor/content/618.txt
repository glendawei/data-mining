HP Chang, the chief operating officer at TrendForce’s Centre for Research Operations, said companies that could be most affected were Yangtze Memory Technology Corp (YMTC) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, plus Korean chipmakers SK Kynix and Samsung, the report said, plus TSMC’s sales of advanced 7nm and 5nm chips from its Taiwan fabs to Chinese clients could also be curtailed, although Taiwan’s economics minister said the ban would only have a limited impact on Taiwanese suppliers.
