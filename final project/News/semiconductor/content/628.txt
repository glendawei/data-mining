US Seen Blocking More Chip Exports From China’s Military The US is expected to announce new moves this week to stop Chinese firms gaining access to chips enabling high-performance computing. The US is expected to announce new moves this week to stop Chinese firms gaining access to chips enabling high-performance computing.  The United States is tipped to announce new moves this week to stop Chinese companies gaining access to technologies enabling high-performance computing. The measures are aimed at restricting China‘s access to advanced computer chips, three sources said. The New York Times was first to report the new restrictions could come as soon as this week, adding that Washington also plans to limit US-made microchips from being sold to China‘s most powerful supercomputing and data centre projects. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Commerce Department declined to comment. The news follows a report last month that the Biden administration planned in October to broaden curbs on US shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools. The rules are part of a stepped up US effort to control technology that could support China‘s military. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said last month in a speech that touched on China and Russia, technology export controls “can be a new strategic asset in the US and allied toolkit to impose costs on adversaries, and even over time degrade their battlefield capabilities.” With technologies like advanced logic and memory chips, Sullivan said, “we must maintain as large of a lead as possible,” he added. In August it was reported that the United States was considering limiting shipments of chipmaking equipment to memory chip makers in China including Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd (YMTC).
