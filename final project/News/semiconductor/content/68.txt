New Report Identifies Target Areas for CHIPS R&D Investments by Semiconductor Industry AssociationSIA-BCG study calls for new federal funds to be directed at five key areas of semiconductor R&DWASHINGTON, Oct. 27, 2022—Following landmark enactment in August 2022 of the CHIPS and Science Act to reinvigorate domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) today released a report identifying five key areas of the semiconductor R&D ecosystem that should be strengthened by the new law’s R&D funding.The report, titled “American Semiconductor Research: Leadership Through Innovation,” highlights the importance of government-industry collaboration on two historic new entities—the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) and the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP)—created by the CHIPS and Science Act. The study also calls for CHIPS funding to be used to bridge key gaps in the current semiconductor R&D ecosystem. Doing so will help pave the way for sustained U.S. chip innovation leadership, according to the report.[DOWNLOAD THE REPORT]“Semiconductor R&D is essential to the innovations powering America’s economy, national security, advanced manufacturing, and critical supply chains,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. “Enactment of the CHIPS and Science Act was a major step toward reinvigorating domestic chip production and innovation for years to come. The ‘Leadership Through Innovation’ study is a roadmap for implementing the new law’s R&D provisions and ensuring sustained U.S. leadership in chip technology.” Based on our extensive consultations with industry technology leaders, the report calls for bolstering the U.S. R&D ecosystem’s capabilities through investments in five key areas:(1) Transitioning and Scaling Pathfinding Research (2) Research Infrastructure and (3) Development Infrastructure  (4) Collaborative Development(5) Workforce# # #
