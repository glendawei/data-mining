SIA Statement on New Export Controls by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—Oct. 7, 2022—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today released the following statement in response to the new export controls (see here and here) announced today by the U.S. Commerce Department. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.“We are assessing the impact of the new export controls on the U.S. semiconductor industry and working with our member companies and the U.S. government to ensure compliance. We understand the goal of ensuring national security and urge the U.S. government to implement the rules in a targeted way—and in collaboration with international partners—to help level the playing field and mitigate unintended harm to U.S. innovation.”# # #
