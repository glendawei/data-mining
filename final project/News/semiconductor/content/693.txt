US Senate to Vote on Semiconductor Bill on Tuesday Trimmed version of Congress bill is expected to include $52 billion in subsidies for the industry and tax credits for firms that make semiconductors in the US Trimmed version of Congress bill is expected to include $52 billion in subsidies for the industry and tax credits for firms that make semiconductors in the US  The US Senate will vote on Tuesday on legislation to boost the domestic semiconductor industry and blunt China’s competitive edge, Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “We need to move quickly,” he said on Monday as the Senate opened for the week. The legislation is a trimmed version of a bill that members of Congress have been working on for well over a year, expected to include $52 billion in subsidies for the industry and a tax credit for companies that manufacture semiconductors in the United States. “Without these incentives from Congress, the capital investment required for expanding production is not economically viable in the US, given other global alternatives,” Schumer said. Lawmakers hope to pass the legislation and send it to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law before they leave Washington for their annual August recess.
