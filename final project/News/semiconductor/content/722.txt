Foxconn Sees 5% Profit Rise Despite Lockdowns, Weak Demand The Taiwanese group, which is a key supplier for Apple, reported a 4% rise in first-quarter revenue despite chip shortages, supply chain issues and reduced demand for electronics The Taiwanese group, which is a key supplier for Apple, reported a 4% rise in first-quarter revenue despite chip shortages, supply chain issues and reduced demand for electronics  Despite severe semiconductor shortages, supply chain issues and reduced demand for consumer and industrial electronics, Apple supplier Foxconn Technology Group managed a 5% rise in first-quarter profits. The Taiwanese company, the world’s largest contract electronics maker, reported a 4% rise in first-quarter revenue and said it expected revenue for both the second quarter and the full year to be flat. Demand for consumer electronics including smartphones – its key growth driver – has stalled due to coronavirus lockdowns in China and travel and other restrictions elsewhere. Net profit for the January-March quarter rose to NT$29.45 billion ($985.48 million), compared with an average analyst estimate of NT$29.76 billion, according to Refinitiv. Foxconn, like other global manufacturers, has grappled with a severe shortage of chips that has squeezed smartphone production, and more recently with a downturn in major markets amid high inflation and the war in Ukraine. While the company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, has previously said that Covid-19 controls in China have only had a limited impact on its production, demand for its products in the country has suffered as people remain shut in. Foxconn shares closed 1% lower ahead of the earnings release, versus a 2.4% drop in the broader market. They have fallen about 2% so far this year, giving the company a market value of $48.1 billion.
