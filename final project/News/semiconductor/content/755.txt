Reshoring US Chip-Making is Not the Answer â€“ Brookings US fabrication of the chips would require not only tremendous up-front costs, but possibly a steady stream of government assistance in perpetuity US fabrication of the chips would require not only tremendous up-front costs, but possibly a steady stream of government assistance in perpetuity  The Covid-19 pandemic brought the consequences of offshoring semiconductors into sharp relief for American consumers and businesses, The Brookings Institution writes. The recognition that semiconductors represent a strategic resource have inspired a push in Washington to rebuild American chip manufacturing. But re-shoring the semiconductor supply chain is unlikely to resolve supply-chain shocks: construction of the most important nodes, namely fabrication of the chips themselves, would require not only tremendous up-front costs, but possibly a steady stream of government assistance in perpetuity.
