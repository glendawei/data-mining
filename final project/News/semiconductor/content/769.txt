Will Taiwan Chip Engineers be Key to Tech Supremacy? – SCMP The US and China may soon be locked in a recruitment battle for Taiwanese semiconductor talent as the world’s most powerful nations bid to ramp up their computer chip capacity The US and China may soon be locked in a recruitment battle for Taiwanese semiconductor talent as the world’s most powerful nations bid to ramp up their computer chip capacity  Analysts say the US and China may soon be locked in a recruitment battle for Taiwanese semiconductor talent as the world’s most powerful nations bid to ramp up domestic chip capacity, according to the South China Morning Post.
