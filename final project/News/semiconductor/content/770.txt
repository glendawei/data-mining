The construction of the new earthquake-resistant facility at its Kitakami plant in Iwate prefecture is scheduled to commence next month and is expected to be completed in 2023, the Japanese chipmaker said in a statement. It did not give investment details and a company spokesperson declined to comment further. A source with knowledge of the matter said separately that the joint venture would be about 1 trillion yen in size and the two companies plan to discuss the venture details including an investment ratio. Kioxia and Western Digital already jointly produce flash memory chips in Japan. Toshiba Corp, which owns a 40.6% stake in Kioxia, said last month that it continues to look at the possibility of a sale of its stake in the firm, and has asked Kioxia to conduct an IPO as soon as possible.  • Reuters with additional editing by Jim Pollard
