Japan’s Fujimi to Restart Production After Cyberattack Fujimi and its subsidiary in Taiwan manufactures a polishing material integral to chip manufacturing, according to a company statement Fujimi and its subsidiary in Taiwan manufactures a polishing material integral to chip manufacturing, according to a company statement  Japanese chemical company Fujimi, which makes a vital component for semiconductors and was hit by a cyberattack last month, said on Wednesday it has partially resumed shipments and is expected to gradually restart production this weekend. Fujimi’s announcement comes amid reports of a surge in cyberattacks against Japanese companies, especially smaller ones. An attack on Toyota Motor supplier Kojima Industries last week forced the carmaker to halt domestic production for a day on Tuesday. Kojima announced on Tuesday morning that it had received a message demanding a ransom and the company confirmed the existence of a virus. Fujimi and its subsidiary in Taiwan were hit by a cyberattack on February 20. The firm manufactures a polishing material, which is integral to chip manufacturing, according to a company statement.    A cybersecurity company, Cyber Security Cloud, based in Tokyo said on Tuesday that unauthorised access against more than 15,000 Japanese firms it surveyed jumped as much as 25 times since February 16 compared with the average of the past three months. Hirokazu Matsuno, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, last week urged domestic companies and organisations to be on their guard against cyberattacks, with possible Russian retaliation for sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine in mind.
