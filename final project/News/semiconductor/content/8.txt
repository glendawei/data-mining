SIA Statement on New Export Controls by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—Oct. 17, 2023—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today released the following statement in response to the new export controls announced today by the U.S. Commerce Department. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.“We are evaluating the impact of the updated export controls on the U.S. semiconductor industry. We recognize the need to protect national security and believe maintaining a healthy U.S. semiconductor industry is an essential component to achieving that goal. Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere. Accordingly, we urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies.”# # #
