Earlier this week, in an annual earnings report, ASML said it had warned its customers against doing business with Dongfang Jinguan, alleging it was marketing products that may infringe on its intellectual property. ASML added it was considering taking legal action against the company. ASML dominates the market for lithography machines critical to making chips out of silicon wafers. US export restrictions have prevented the company from shipping its most breakthrough extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology to customers in China. The curbs in effect prevent Chinese companies from manufacturing advanced computer chips.  • Reuters with additional editing by Jim Pollard
