CSconnected welcomes UK’s £160m semiconductor investment zone in South Wales A recently  announced investment zone in the UK is to focus on further strengthening the  CSconnected semiconductor cluster based in and around South Wales. Welsh Government Economy Minister Vaughan Gething recommended  that Wales should be home to two of the 12 investment zones across the UK  and that the South Wales zone should focus on strengthening the  CSconnected semiconductor cluster. In his Autumn Statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt  confirmed the go ahead for the £160m investment zone for semiconductors in  South Wales. Investment zones form part of the UK’s levelling-up strategy to  focus on a small number of high-potential clusters linked to strong research,  innovation and manufacturing capabilities. The South Wales semiconductor  cluster is recognised as a key capability that can provide a path to stronger  economic growth in Wales and the UK as a whole. “Our dependence on  semiconductors became abundantly clear during the COVID pandemic when demand  for technologies enabled by our sector created severe shortages across many  end-markets,” says CSconnected’s  director Chris Meadows. “Specializing in compound semiconductor technologies, Wales plays a  key role within this essential industry sector that is at the heart of our  digital world from handsets to data centers, mobility and  net-zero applications, healthcare, robotics and AI,” he adds. “We look forward to  continuing working closely with the Welsh Government and Cardiff Capital Region to design the Investment Zone interventions that  will accelerate growth in prosperity, talent and economic value from our  thriving semiconductor sector across our region and beyond,” says Wyn  Meredith, chair of CSconnected’s management group.
