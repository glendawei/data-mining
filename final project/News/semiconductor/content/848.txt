ROHM expands library of LTspice models to over 3500 by adding SiC and IGBTs Japan’s ROHM has expanded its lineup of SPICE models for the LTspice  circuit simulator, increasing its number of LTspice models to more than 3500  for discretes (which can be downloaded from product pages). In addition to the existing lineup of bipolar transistors, diodes  and MOSFETs, ROHM has added silicon carbide (SiC) power devices and insulated-gate  bipolar transistors (IGBTs) to the library. This brings the coverage of LTspice  models on ROHM’s website to over 80% of all products, providing greater  convenience to designers when using circuit simulators that incorporate  discrete products, now including power devices. LTspice is also equipped  with circuit diagram capture and waveform viewer functions that make  it possible for designers to check and verify in advance whether the circuit  operation has been achieved as designed.  In recent years, the increasing use of circuit simulation for  circuit design has expanded the number of tools being utilized. Among these,  LTspice is an attractive option for a range of users, from students to seasoned  engineers at well-known companies. Besides product pages, ROHM added a Design Models page in  October that allows simulation models to be downloaded directly, supporting  LTspice and other tool environments. Documentation on how to add libraries and  create symbols (schematic symbols) is also available to facilitate circuit  design and simulation execution. 
   Going forward, ROHM will continue to contribute to solving circuit  design issues by expanding the number of models compatible with various  simulators while providing web tools such as ROHM Solution Simulator to meet growing  customer needs.
