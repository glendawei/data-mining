SIA Applauds Renewal of WTO Tariff Moratorium, Urges WTO to Make it Permanent by Semiconductor Industry AssociationWASHINGTON—June 17, 2022—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today released the following statement from President and CEO John Neuffer in support of the outcomes produced by the World Trade Organization’s (WTO’s) 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12). Among the critical results achieved during the ministerial was a renewal of the WTO Moratorium on Customs Duties on Electronic Transmissions, an agreement that has served as a foundation for global digital trade for the last quarter-century.“After a rocky start, MC12 produced important outcomes for global trade in semiconductors and a range of other essential technologies, services, and industrial products. We greatly appreciate the strong leadership of Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and the tireless work of the U.S. negotiating team and all Ministers to deliver positive results, including the agreement to extend the WTO Moratorium on Customs Duties on Electronic Transmissions until the next Ministerial. For nearly 25 years, the Moratorium has supported the explosive growth of global trade for big and small companies across all sectors, including Internet-related services, entertainment, semiconductors, and consumer and industrial electronics.“Ultimately, the WTO needs to make the Moratorium permanent, so we can put behind us the highly unpredictable renewal process that exposes the global economy and America’s industries and workers to damaging uncertainty. SIA stands ready to make this case forcefully while demonstrating to developed and developing countries alike the benefits of keeping digital goods and services free of import duties across all sectors.”# # #
