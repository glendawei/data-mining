Odyssey names co-founder, CTO & board member Rick Brown as CEO Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies Inc of  Ithaca, NY, USA — which develops high-voltage vertical power switching  components based on proprietary gallium nitride (GaN) processing  technology — says that  co-founder, chief technology officer  & board member Rick Brown has  been appointed as CEO. He replaces Mark Davidson, who has stepped down as CEO  and board member, and is no longer  employed at Odyssey. Due to cost-reduction actions, both Mark Davidson and chief  accounting officer Laura Krauss have  moved to consulting roles for the company going forward. As stated previously, Odyssey is currently looking for longer-term  financing and exploring strategic alternatives and continues to be financially  constrained. “We have continued to make progress with scaling our vertical GaN technology and developing the  manufacturing process to build a larger device that can handle higher current.  This larger device will enable us to more widely sample to customers to  demonstrate the technology operating at a level which is more likely to be used  by customers,” says the firm. “Odyssey’s approach to vertical GaN will offer even greater commercial  advantages over silicon, silicon carbide  or lateral GaN. Vertical GaN offers a 10x advantage over silicon carbide (SiC) at performance enabling  smaller and lighter power systems  and cost levels we believe are  unattainable by the competing technologies,” it adds. “We are also making  progress with foundry services  projects. Our pipeline has grown with initial work being completed providing  revenue in Q4 with good potential volume, recurring revenue clients for 2024  and beyond. This has also led to some rebalancing of resource deployment  between internal product development  and externally focused foundry service  projects. We are also continuing to review strategic opportunities to address  longer-term financing needs.”
