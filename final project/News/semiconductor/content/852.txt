Q-Pixel develops smallest full-color pixel and demonstrates first 10,000PPI full-color micro-LED display Q-Pixel Inc of Los Angeles, CA, USA has developed what  it claims is the world’s smallest full-color pixel and demonstrated it in the  first ever 10,000PPI, full-color micro-LED display (surpassing the firm’s  previous record 5000PPI full-color display, announced in May). Resolution of 10,000PPI has previously been exhibited only in  monochromatic, single-color displays. However, for the first time, Q-Pixel has  achieved 10,000PPI resolution in full color using its proprietary tunable  polychromatic light-emitting diode (TP-LED), which can emit the full range of  visible light within a single pixel. Using TP-LED, Q-Pixel now has the unique  capability of fabricating extremely small, fully color-tunable single pixels  with diameters as small as 1 μm.

Micro-LED technology offers several key benefits over existing  OLED and LCD display technologies, notably, longer lifetime, superior  brightness and energy efficiency. However, the complex, costly and  labor-intensive process of assembling full-color micro-LED displays using  monochromatic red, green and blue (RGB) LED subpixels remains a major barrier  to both high-resolution displays and commercially viable displays.  Ultra-high-resolution, full-color displays are especially sought after for  near-eye applications, such as those used in augmented-reality/virtual-reality  (AR/VR) devices. Q-Pixel reckons that showcasing the smallest full-color pixel and  10000PPI full-color display highlights the advantages of TP-LED pixel  technology over RGB micro-LED subpixels. The results were presented in the TechBlick event ‘Mini- & Micro-LED Displays: Markets,  Manufacturing Innovations, Applications, Promising Start-ups’ on  29–30 November.
