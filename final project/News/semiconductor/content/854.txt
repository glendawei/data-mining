Guerrilla RF launches GRF2110 5–8GHz LNA for C-band receiver applications Guerrilla RF Inc (GRF) of Greensboro, NC,  USA — which develops and manufactures radio-frequency integrated circuits  (RFICs) and monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) for wireless  applications — has announced  the formal production release of its  GRF2110, an ultra-low-noise  amplifier that delivers what is said to be an exceptionally flat gain response  over a single 5–8GHz broadband tune. When operated at 6GHz, the device delivers 16.3dB of gain,  22dBm of OP1dB compression, 38dBm of OIP3 linearity, and a low noise figure  (NF) of 1.2dB (as measured on the device’s standard evaluation board;  de-embedded NF values are about 0.2dB lower). As with most of GRF’s amplifier  cores, the GRF2110 touts a flexible biasing architecture, allowing for  customizable tradeoffs in linearity and power consumption. Supply voltages  can vary between 2.7V and 6V, although most customers will elect to use a  standard 5V supply with 70mA of biasing current. “Given its native operating band, the GRF2110 will be a  compelling LNA for satellite communications, aeronautical telemetry, radar,  industrial scientific & medical (ISM), WiFi 6E, and 5G cellular  infrastructure applications targeting new n96, n102 and n104 bands in the 5.9–7.2GHz  range,” says Jim Ahne, VP of automotive and 5G products. “In each of these end markets,  customers are continuously seeking LNA cores offering an excellent blend of low noise,  high linearity and high compression performance – critical for  enhancing a system’s overall receiver sensitivity while overcoming link  impairments due to blocker interference.” The GRF2110 utilizes Guerilla RF’s 1.5mm x 1.5mm  DFN-6 package – the firm’s ultra-small packaging option supporting a common  footprint for over 30 devices. The entire family of parts provide customers  with a multitude of options for addressing different frequency, gain, noise figure,  compression and linearity requirements. This modular approach is said to be  popular with GRF’s client base, since it provides an exceptional degree of  design latitude, translating directly into design speed and agility. Samples and evaluation boards are available for the  GRF2110. Prices start at $1.76 (10,000-up, EXW USA).
