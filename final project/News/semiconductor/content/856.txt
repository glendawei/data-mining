ST extends MasterGaN performance with new 200W and 500W devices STMicroelectronics of Geneva, Switzerland says that its new MasterGaN1L and  MasterGaN4L introduce the next generation of integrated gallium nitride  (GaN) bridge devices that simplify power supply design leveraging  wide-bandgap technology to achieve the latest eco-design targets. STâ€™s MasterGaN family combines 650V GaN high-electron-mobility  transistors (HEMTs) with optimized gate drivers, system protection and an  integrated bootstrap diode that helps to power the device at startup.  Integrating these features saves designers tackling the complex gate-drive  requirements of GaN transistors. Housed in a compact power package, the  devices are also said to enhance reliability, cut the bill of materials,  and ease circuit layout. The latest devices contain two GaN HEMTs connected in half-bridge  configuration. The arrangement is suitable for building switched-mode power supplies,  adapters, and chargers with active-clamp flyback, active-clamp forward  and resonant converter topologies. The MasterGaN1L and MasterGaN4L are pin compatible  with MasterGaN1 and MasterGaN4, respectively. Compared with the earlier  devices, they have a newly optimized turn-on delay that allows working at  higher frequency and higher efficiency with low load, especially in resonant  topologies. The inputs accept signal voltages from 3.3V to 15V, with  hysteresis and pull-down that facilitate connecting directly to a controlling  device such as a micro-controller, digital  signal processor (DSP) or Hall-effect sensors. A dedicated shutdown pin  helps designers to save system power and the two GaN HEMTs have accurately  matched timing with an interlocking circuit to prevent cross-conduction  conditions.
