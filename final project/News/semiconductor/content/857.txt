Wolfspeed completes sale of RF business to MACOM for $75m cash plus $60.8m in stock Wolfspeed Inc of Durham, NC, USA — which makes silicon carbide  materials as well as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN)  power-switching & RF semiconductor devices — has completed the sale of its radio frequency business (Wolfspeed RF)  to MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Inc of  Lowell, MA, USA (which designs and makes RF, microwave, analog and mixed-signal  and optical semiconductor technologies). Wolfspeed received about $75m  in cash (subject to a customary purchase price adjustment) and 711,528 shares of MACOM common stock, worth about $60.8m (based on its closing price on 1 December, as reported on the Nasdaq  Global Select Market). “The completed  sale of Wolfspeed RF is the final step in our transformation,” says president  & CEO Gregg Lowe. “Wolfspeed is now the only pure-play silicon carbide semiconductor manufacturer in the  industry,” he adds. “As demand continues to accelerate across the automotive,  industrial and renewable energy  markets, we can now focus on innovation and capacity for our materials and  power device businesses.” Wolfspeed says  that it continues to drive the industry transition to silicon carbide with its ongoing capacity  expansion, including the final build-out of its Mohawk Valley Fab in New York,  and construction of the John Palmour  Manufacturing Center (the JP, the  world’s largest silicon carbide  materials factory) in Siler City,  North Carolina. The  multi-billion-dollar facility is targeted to generate a more than 10-fold  increase from Wolfspeed’s current silicon carbide  production capacity on its campus in Durham, NC.
