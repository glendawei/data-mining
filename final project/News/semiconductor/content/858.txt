Luminus launches LUX 3030 and 2835 LEDs with KSF red phosphor technology Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA, USA –  which designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology (SST) light sources  for illumination markets – has  launched the LUX 3030 and 2835 series, featuring KSF narrow-band red phosphor technology. The LEDs deliver a  120° typical viewing angle and minimum 90 CRI  with very high lumen/watt efficacy for high-performance general lighting applications including  replacement lamps, panel lighting, downlights, and architectural  lighting. They are compatible with automatic placement equipment as well as  with infrared reflow solder  processes and are RoHS and REACH compliant. “These LEDs, with their high efficiency, outstanding color rendering, and use of reliable  CurrentTriGain KSF, will undoubtedly revolutionize the landscape of general lighting applications,” reckons senior  business line director Yves Bertic. Maintaining a high level of efficiency is important worldwide but  is of increased significance in Europe, where energy efficiency incentives are gaining prominence. With efficacy  as high as 207 lumens per watt,  the LUX Midpower series is strategically being adopted by customers to qualify  for such incentives. These incentives typically mandate that the entire  lighting system, including optics and drivers, achieve a minimum of 120 lumens per watt. Given the significant global  increase in energy costs and the growing demand for superior lighting quality, the launch of these new products  is opportune, reckons the firm. The LUX Series of COBs and SMD LEDs is available now through  Luminus’ authorized distributors.
