Sivers receives $1m in orders for advanced optical sensing in LiDAR, medical and industrial applications IC and integrated module supplier Sivers  Semiconductors AB of Kista, Sweden says that its subsidiary Sivers Photonics of Glasgow, Scotland, UK has received new orders worth $1m (about SEK10m) for advanced  optical sensing products from three customers across light detection &  ranging (LiDAR), medical and industrial sectors. The orders, from several US based customers, were received  during the first part of fourth-quarter 2023 and will result in the manufacturing  of advanced laser and optical amplifier products for  critical applications, with the majority of the delivery expected throughout  2024. With a production facility in Glasgow and over 20 years’  experience in the design and fabrication of customized III-V compound semiconductor  devices, Sivers Photonics is a supplier of laser light sources  to the silicon photonics industry, working across a range of  customers from Fortune 100 businesses to highly funded, high growth  startups. The latest orders are the result of an increase in demand for  Sivers’ lasers as companies engineer next-generation products for autonomous vehicles  (AV) and smart factories, innovative  medical devices  and equipment, and multiple new applications across a range of industries. “These  production orders demonstrate the continued strong organic growth across  established and emerging optical sensing markets and further validate the technical  capability of Sivers Photonics’ UK wafer fabrication  facility,” says Sivers Photonics’ managing director Andy McKee. “We  have put up a medium-term goal of increasing product sales from currently 30%  of our revenue to over 80% by 2026,” says Sivers Semiconductors’ CEO Anders Storm. “This is one of many  product orders we therefore expect to see, to secure our continued growth that  will be fueled by an increased share of product revenue in the coming years.”
