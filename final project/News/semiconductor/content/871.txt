Government contract revenue  was $1.46m, halving from $2.9m last quarter but still up by $1m year-on-year. Gross margin was a  more-than-expected 23.4%, down from 35.5% last quarter due to lower mix of  government contract revenue, but up by 11.5% year-on-year. “We continue to  progress toward our long-term model of gross margins in excess of 40%,” says chief financial officer Cameron McAulay. On a non-GAAP basis,  operating expenses were $6.4m, up from $5.2m a year ago but cut from $6.83m last quarter.

During the quarter, cash,  cash equivalents and restricted cash rose from $3.3m to $6.152m, after a rights offering of common  stock at the end of July raised $7.94m. “We meaningfully  reduced cash burn from $6.8m for  the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to $5.1m for Q2 fiscal 2024, and we continue  to have zero debt on our balance sheet, which puts us in a strong position to  secure additional non-dilutive funding,” says McAulay. “We engaged BofA  Securities to advance our previously announced strategic review process, and we  are continuing this process as we seek to enhance stockholder value, pursuing  multiple options that include the potential merger or sale of the company,”  says CEO & co-founder Dr Primit Parikh. Highlights during the  quarter are listed as: Transphorm  continued to grow its five-year pipeline opportunity — now at over $475m,  of which about 70% is in high power, and also up 5% from the prior update in  August of $450m. With traction in design-ins and opportunities entering or  nearing production, the firm expects a continuation of its sequential product  revenue growth in fiscal third-quarter 2024. “We were pleased with  the continued growth of our pipeline and our design wins, highlighted by record growth in  high-power design wins,” says Parikh. “We anticipate continued strong growth in  product revenue in our third fiscal quarter as we realize the benefits of  converting our burgeoning design-ins into revenue-generating contracts.”
