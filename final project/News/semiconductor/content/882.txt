US DOE announces $42m in funding for first 15 projects in ULTRAFAST program Funded through its program ULTRAFAST (‘Lasting Transformative  Resiliency Advances by Faster Actuation of power Semiconductor  Technologies’) launched on 24 February, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has  now announced $42m for 15 projects across 11 states to improve the reliability,  resiliency and flexibility of the domestic power grid through the  development of next-generation semiconductor technologies. The technologies being developed would enable more effective  control of grid power flow and better protection of critical  infrastructure assets. Streamlining the coordinated operation of electricity  supply and demand can improve operational efficiency, prevent unforeseen  outages, allow faster recovery, minimize the impacts of natural disasters and  climate-change-fueled extreme weather events, and reduce grid operating costs  and carbon intensity. The announcement supports President Biden’s Investing in America  agenda to modernize the USA’s power grid, accelerate the deployment of  clean energy resources, and boost both energy and national security. “Modernizing our nation’s aging power grid is critical to  strengthening our national and energy security, and absolutely essential to  reaching President Biden’s ambitious goal of a net-zero economy by 2050,” says US Secretary of  Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “This new investment will support  project teams across the country as they develop the innovative technologies we  need to strengthen our grid security and bring reliable clean electricity to  more families and businesses — all while combatting the climate crisis.” Managed by DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E),  the selected projects are as follows:
