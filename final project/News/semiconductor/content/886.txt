Infinera awarded $14m, five-year CalCompetes grant Infinera Corp of San Jose, CA, USA — a  vertically integrated manufacturer of digital optical network systems — has been awarded a California Competes  (CalCompetes) grant worth up to $14m over five years  by the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development  (GO-Biz). This is a first step to expanding and modernizing Infinera’s US-based  domestic production of compound semiconductors  and continuing to support innovation and economic development in the USA in  future years. The grant will enable Infinera —  which has in-house fab operations and test & packaging capabilities in  multiple states — to build upon its 20+ year history in the USA and continue to  drive innovation in indium phosphide  (InP)-based compound semiconductor  and monolithic photonic integrated circuit  (PIC) technologies. It is expected that fostering domestic production of these  critical technologies will help to increase the USA’s economic and national  security in semiconductor innovation, manufacturing and supply chain resilience. The CalCompetes Grant Program is one of California’s main  incentive programs to leverage tens of billions of dollars of federal funds  available under the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors  (CHIPS) Act, which is designed to encourage growth and expansion of  semiconductor manufacturing and R&D in the USA. The grant is “an important step in helping to boost America’s  domestic production of semiconductor technologies,” reckons Infinera’s CEO  David Heard. “Since our founding, we chose to keep our optical compound semiconductor fab and advanced packaging  operations in the United States,” he adds. “We remain committed to leveraging  our unique expertise, talent and capabilities to support the goals of US  federal and state initiatives focused on economic development and national  security.”
