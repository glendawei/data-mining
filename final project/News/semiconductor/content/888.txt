onsemi opens systems application lab for EVs in Europe Intelligent power and  sensing technology firm onsemi of Scottsdale, AZ, USA has opened an application test lab in  Piestany, Slovakia, focused on the advancement of system solutions for  battery/plug-in hybrid/electric vehicles (xEVs) and  energy infrastructure (EI) power conversion systems. The systems  applications lab provides specialized equipment to develop and test  next-generation silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC) solutions in  collaboration with automotive OEMs, tier-1s and energy infrastructure (EI)  providers.  The new lab will play a central role in  ensuring that the development of future power products results in highly  differentiated, value-add solutions tailored to customers’ specific  requirements for highly efficient power conversion in xEV powertrains and  charging, as well as applications in renewable energy. The new facility consists of two  high-voltage power labs that focus on systems- and device-level  development as well as evaluation of SiC/Si traction inverters and AC–DC/DC–DC  power converters. Laser welding facilities, mechanical cleanrooms and  workshops further enable fast prototyping and testing of next-generation system  solutions. Evaluation capabilities for the  next-generation system solutions include:
