Q-Pixel joins Silicon Catalyst to accelerate full-color micro-LED display development To accelerate development of its  full-color displays manufactured with tunable polychromatic LEDs, fabless micro-LED  display innovator Q-Pixel Inc of Los Angeles,  CA, USA has joined Silicon Valley-based Silicon Catalyst,  the world’s only incubator focused exclusively on accelerating early-stage  semiconductor hardware companies. Q-Pixel has developed a single LED pixel  that can be tuned across the full color spectrum rather than requiring  three pixels (red, green, blue) to achieve full color. This enables Q-Pixel’s  displays to deliver higher resolution and more brightness with less power consumption  and lower cost, it is claimed. Earlier this year, Q-Pixel demonstrated the  highest micro-LED density in the world, the firm adds. Its technology targets  high-resolution displays for screen sizes ranging from personal (smartphones  and wearable devices) to large (greater than 100 inch). The Silicon Catalyst ecosystem — which includes a coalition  of in-kind and strategic partners that reduce the cost and complexity of  development along with a network of experienced advisors that coach and connect  startup entrepreneurs — helps early-stage  semiconductor hardware companies to address the challenges of moving from idea  to realization while simultaneously de-risking the companies for investors. “Q-Pixel is delighted to join Silicon  Catalyst as a portfolio company. We expect their extensive ecosystem will help  us engage with customers and build a profitable business around our  technology,” says Q-Pixel’s co-founder & CEO J.C. Chen. “We are impressed with the company’s  vision and progress,” comments Silicon Catalyst’s chief operating officer Nick  Kepler. “Our comprehensive ecosystem of advisors, strategic & in-kind  partners, and investors look forward to helping them on their journey to  deliver innovative products to their target markets.”
