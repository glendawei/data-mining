Infineon adds 62mm package to CoolSiC 1200V and 2000V MOSFET module families Infineon  Technologies AG of Munich, Germany has  expanded its CoolSiC 1200V and 2000V MOSFET module families with a new  industry-standard package. The proven 62mm device is designed in half-bridge  topology and is based on the recently introduced M1H silicon carbide (SiC)  MOSFET technology. The package enables the use of SiC for mid-power  applications from 250kW – where silicon reaches the limits of  power density with insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) technology.  Compared to a 62mm IGBT module, the list of applications now additionally  includes solar, server, energy storage,  electric vehicle (EV) charger,  traction, commercial  induction cooking and power conversion systems.  Picture:    Infineon’s 62mm CoolSiC MOSFET module. The M1H  technology enables a significantly wider gate voltage window, ensuring  high robustness to driver and layout-induced voltage spikes at the gate without  any restrictions even at high switching frequencies. In addition to that,  very low switching and transmission losses minimize cooling requirements.  Combined with a high reverse voltage, these devices meet another  requirement of modern system design. By using Infineon’s CoolSiC chip  technology, converter designs can be made more efficient, the nominal power per inverter  can be increased and system costs can be reduced, says Infineon.
