BluGlass to receive full $7.3m R&D rebate from Australian Taxation Office BluGlass Ltd of Silverwater, Australia — which  develops and manufactures gallium nitride (GaN) blue laser  diodes based on its proprietary low-temperature, low-hydrogen remote-plasma  chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD)  technology — has received confirmation from the Australian Taxation  Office that it will receive its full $7.3m rebate for R&D activities  carried out across its Australian and US facilities in fiscal year 2023. The  firm expects to receive the funds within 10 business days. “Our R&D rebate has increased more than 80% over the prior  year, reflecting our significant step-up in development activities following  our acquisition of a purpose-built production facility in Silicon Valley,”  says CEO Jim Haden. “This R&D work has enabled us to launch our first suite of  visible lasers, commence customer engagement and product qualification and  secure our commercial role as part of the CLAWS Hub [‘Commercial Leap Ahead for Wide-bandgap  Semiconductors’] in the US Microelectronics Commons,” he adds. “At the same time, we continue to improve the quality, consistency  and performance of our launched products, and expedite the development of  next-generation lasers,” Haden continues. “The R&D rebate is a non-dilutive  cash injection that supports our ground-breaking technology development  and helps offset our operational costs as we commercialize our gallium nitride  laser technology.” See  related items: BluGlass a commercial partner in US Microelectronics Commons  regional innovation hub CLAWS BluGlass’ highlights new  GaN laser orders for quantum sensing and surgical applications, and  improvements to DFB lasers
