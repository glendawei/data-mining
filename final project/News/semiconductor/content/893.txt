AquiSense launches PearlAqua Kilo for industrial applications AquiSense Technologies LLC  of Erlanger, KY, USA (which designs and makes UV-C LED water disinfection systems) has introduced  the PearlAqua Kilo system, designed for industrial applications. It is the  smaller sibling to the PearlAqua Tera, which is designed for municipal  applications and was released in early 2022. The Kilo and Tera integrate LEDs  into a compact design without the use of harmful chemicals. “Some in the industry had doubts LED technology could be  engineered at this large of scale, but we have proven that it’s not only  possible but effective,” says president & CEO Oliver Lawal. “We have  multiple installations of the Kilo and Tera units already providing reliable  and safe water treatment solution for our customers and, with third-party  validation work being completed now, we expect strong growth going into 2024.” The PearlAqua Kilo uses UV-C LED technology to provide over  99.99% pathogen reduction at 1.3MGD (205m3/hr). It features instant on/off, a replaceable lamp  module, an advanced cooling design, and real-time UV intensity monitoring.
