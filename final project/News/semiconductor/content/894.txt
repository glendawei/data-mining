CVD Equipment’s Q3 revenue down 23.2% year-on-year due to lower system revenue For third-quarter 2023, CVD Equipment Corp  of Central Islip, NY, USA (a designer and maker of chemical vapor  deposition, thermal processing, physical vapor  transport, gas and chemical delivery control systems, and other equipment and  process solutions for developing and manufacturing materials and coatings) has  reported revenue of $6.2m, up 21.6% on $5.1m last quarter but down 23.2%  on $8.1m a year ago due primarily to lower system revenues. However, as a result of a modification to certain customer  contracts, revenue recognition for certain contracts changed from ‘point in time’  to ‘over time’. The firm hence  recorded an increase in revenue of $0.8m during Q3/2023 that was deferred as of  30 June and recognized on the date  of the contract modification. “Our order and revenue levels have historically fluctuated, which  is often typical in the highly cyclical process equipment industry. While we  saw a year-over-year decline in third-quarter revenue of $1.9m, our  year-to-date 2023 revenue of $20m was 7.6% higher than [the $18.6m of] the  corresponding period in the prior fiscal year,” notes president & CEO Emmanuel  Lakios. “While we are disappointed with our third-quarter revenue, we continue  to see opportunities in key strategic markets of high-power electronics,  battery materials/energy storage and aerospace & defense,” he adds. Gross margin was consistent with recent quarters at 25.6%, but  less than 29.8% a year ago due principally to lower revenue and changes in  contract mix. Net loss has been cut from $1.1m ($0.16 per share) in Q2/2023 to  $0.75m ($0.11 per share) in Q3/2023, but this compares with net income of  $63,000 ($0.01 per share) a year ago. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of  Q3/2023 was $14.29m. Order intake was $4.1m in Q3/2023, including about $2m from  continued demand from the aerospace sector, expected to be delivered over the  next 12 months. Also contributing  were orders of about $0.9m from research institutions. Nevertheless, during  Q3/2023 order backlog fell from $18.8m to $16.6m.  CVD Equipment continues to make investments in both R&D and sales &  marketing, focused on the firm’s three key strategic markets. In the high-power electronics market, there were no PVT150 system  orders received in the first nine months of 2023. The firm expanded its  marketing efforts, including direct outreach to multiple potential customers as  well as attendance at key silicon carbide-related  trade shows and conferences  including the International Conference on  Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM 2023) in  September. The engaged customers include both silicon carbide wafer manufacturers as well as fully integrated  wafer and device manufacturers. “The success of our PVT150 and PVT200 systems  marketing efforts is dependent on the performance of our equipment in the  field, overall market conditions, our customers’ ability to qualify their end product with their customers, and our  customers’ ability to obtain the funding necessary to purchase our equipment,”  says CVD Equipment. During Q3/2023, Ms Deb  Wasser and Dr Ashraf Lotfi were  added to the board of directors. Wasser brings extensive experience in  corporate governance and financial communications. Lotfi brings an in-depth  knowledge of the power electronics  market. On 8 August, CVD Equipment entered into a purchase and  license agreement with a third party  to sell certain assets and license certain proprietary information of  MesoScribe in exchange for $0.9m, payable in several installments and  contingent upon certain performance metrics and other milestones. The firm  expects the transaction to be completed in Q4/2023 with the shipment of the  equipment to the purchaser. “We remain committed to stay the course on our strategy to achieve  consistent long-term profitability, with a focus on growth and return on  investment,” says Lakios. “Our return to profitability is subject to our  ability to receive additional system orders and continue our efforts to reduce  our overall operating costs.”
