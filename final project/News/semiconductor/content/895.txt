Raytheon wins $15m four-year DARPA THREADS contract to boost RF sensors US-based Raytheon, a business of aerospace & defense company  RTX, has been awarded a four-year, $15m contract  from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to increase  the electronic capability of radio frequency sensors with  high-power-density gallium nitride (GaN) transistors.  The improved transistors will have 16 times higher output power than  traditional GaN with no increase in operating temperature. Raytheon claims to be the world’s leading manufacturer of  military-grade gallium nitride which, when used in radar systems, improves  range and radar resource management handling. This new prototyping work is  being performed under DARPA’s program THREADS (Technologies  for Heat Removal in Electronics at the Device Scale). “Our engineers have unlocked a new way to produce  gallium nitride, where thermal management is no longer a limiting factor,”  says Colin Whelan, president of Advanced Technology  at Raytheon. “These new system architectures will result in sensors with  enhanced range.” Raytheon is partnering with the Naval Research Laboratory, Stanford University and Diamond Foundry to grow diamond,  the best thermal conductor, for integration with military-grade GaN transistors  and circuits. Cornell University, Michigan State University, the University of  Maryland and Penn State  University are also providing technology and performance analysis. For nearly 25 years, Raytheon has invested in gallium nitride  R&D, using it in defense systems like the Patriot, LTAMDS/GhostEye family  of radars, APG-79(v)4 and SPY-6 family of radars. Work on this contract is being conducted in Andover, Massachusetts.
