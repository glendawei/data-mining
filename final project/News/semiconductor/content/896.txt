Full-color active-matrix micro-LED micro-displays Hong Kong  University of Science and Technology in China reports progress in fabricating  prototype full-color active-matrix micro-LED micro-displays with 391 pixels per inch (ppi) density and “decent”  color gamut [Longheng  Qi et al, Light: Science & Applications, v12, p258 2023]. The 200x80-resolution device consisted of  indium gallium nitride  (InGaN, blue/green) and aluminium gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP, red) micro-LED  arrays flip-chip bonded to a silicon (Si) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) backplane. Such micro-display formats are being  developed for augmented-reality/mixed-reality (AR/MR) application. The researchers comment: “The performance  of the current prototype is limited by the yet-to-be-optimized GaN-on-Si  dual-wavelength LED epiwafers and the CMOS driver”. A further  concern is yields, “primarily determined by the integration step of the  monolithic AlGaInP red micro-LED array.” The 200x80 (0.55-inch diagonal) full-color  (RGB) displays were constructed from flip-chip bonding of InGaN blue/green and  AlGaInP red micro-LED arrays (Figure 1).  The dual-color InGaN devices generated their light from multiple quantum wells (MQWs) consisting of three bottom blue wells, a single green well, and two top blue wells.  The InGaN LED structure was grown on a 4-inch silicon substrate.
