NUBURU wins purchase order from multi-national electronics manufacturer NUBURU Inc of Centennial, CO, USA — which was founded in 2015 and  develops and manufactures high-power industrial blue lasers — has been awarded a purchase order from a  multi-national electronics manufacturer with manufacturing capabilities across  Asia, Latin America, Europe and the  USA to supply a BL-250 for next-generation computers, consumer electronics and communication (3C) device  manufacturing. NUBURU says  that its blue laser technology will  be utilized in an R&D capacity to demonstrate the integration of its laser welding capabilities as an alternative to  conventional soldering manufacturing techniques. “By  integrating our modular manufacturing solutions, we provide customers with the  means for increased scalability and ability to produce more durable products,”  says CEO Brian Knaley. “We look forward to the continued market adoption of our  BL product line, as the increasing demand for innovative capabilities and green  manufacturing alternatives continues to accelerate.” Laser joining  in its current state faces significant challenges rooted in energy-intensive  soldering practices, resulting in inefficiencies and constraints on the  precision and reliability of precise metal fabrication,  notes NUBURU. By integrating its patented BL-250 product, existing  manufacturing capabilities are expanded to enable new product designs, increase manufacturing  throughput, enhance the overall sustainability of manufacturing, and achieving  ROHS compliance by eliminating  lead-based solders.
