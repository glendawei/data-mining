Marktech launches 235nm and 255nm UVC LEDs Marktech Optoelectronics Inc of Latham, NY,  USA, a designer and manufacturer of optoelectronics components and assemblies — including UV, visible,  near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters, detectors, indium  phosphide (InP) epiwafers and other compound semiconductors — has released 235nm and 255nm UVC LEDs made by  Silanna UV of Brisbane, Australia, housed in flat and dome lens SMD  and TO-can packages (e.g. MTE2350F-UV and MTE2350D-UV). Picture:       Silanna UVC LED  in flat lens  SMD package. For germicidal UV applications, the Silanna Safe 235nm-emitting  chips inside the UVC LEDs are said  to provide outstanding power efficiency  without the skin cancer risks  associated with higher-wavelength UVC LEDs. Designed for diverse germicidal UV  and chemical sensing applications,  Marktech can also provide the new 235nm and 255nm LEDs in custom packaging. In  2024, the firm will be releasing these UVC LED chips in a variety of packages  including its hermetic metal-ceramic ATLAS package. Applications include: Marktech says that a feature of their UVC LEDs is their safety  profile. Unlike UVB and UVA LEDs, unintentional overexposure to Marktech 235nm  UVC results in only short-term redness and eye irritation, eliminating the risk  of skin cancer and cataracts. “Marktech’s commitment to advancing UV lighting technology is  evident in these 235nm and 255nm UVC LEDs from Silanna,” says Marktech  Optoelectronics’ chief technology officer  Vince Forte. “We’re not just offering a product; we’re offering a safer, more  efficient and environmentally friendly solution for many applications.”
