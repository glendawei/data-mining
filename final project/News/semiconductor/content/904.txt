NUBURU announces $5.5m bridge financing NUBURU Inc of Centennial, CO, USA — which  was founded in 2015 and develops and manufactures high-power industrial blue lasers  — has agreed a secured bridge loan worth $5.5m with existing investors  and a new institutional investor in order to finance the firm until it secures  long-term credit financing, which is anticipated in the near term. “The bridge financing is an important step on our way to a  longer-term credit facility intended to support the commercialization of our  blue lasers,” says CEO Brian Knaley. The bridge loan consists of zero-interest promissory notes issued  with a 10% original issue discount, which will mature when NUBURU closes the  anticipated credit facility (or 12 months  after issuance at the latest). The notes are secured by NUBURU’s patent  portfolio, which was independently and preliminarily valued to be worth $100m.  Following acceptance by the NYSE of the firm’s supplemental listing  application, NUBURU will also issue to the holders of notes warrants  exercisable for common stock equal  to 100% of the note principal, which will be exercisable for $0.25 per share,  have a five-year term, and may be repurchased by the company when the trading  price exceeds $1.50 for 20 out of 30 trading days.  If the notes have not been repaid within six or nine months after issuance, the  notes will begin to bear interest (at the SOFR rate  plus 9% and at the SOFR rate plus  12%, respectively) and additional 25% warrant coverage will be provided at each  such date. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement between the firm and the  holders of warrants, NUBURU intends to register the common stock underlying the warrants no later  than 1 February 2024. The parties to the bridge financing also entered into an  inter-creditor and subordination agreement with the holders of senior secured  convertible notes, whose convertible  notes will now be secured and rank senior in priority to the notes. Northland Capital Markets acted as sole placement agent on the  institutional investor portion of the bridge financing.
