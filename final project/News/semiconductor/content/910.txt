ams OSRAM’s third generation of OSLON Submount PL LEDs boosts brightness in automotive forward lighting ams OSRAM GmbH of Premstätten, Austria and Munich, Germany has launched the next generation of its  OSLON Submount PL family of  LEDs, offering higher brightness and more design flexibility to manufacturers  of automotive forward lighting  modules and products. Based on internal data, the third-generation OSLON Submount PL  LEDs are about 9% brighter than the second generation, giving automotive  manufacturers the potential to reduce the system cost of new headlamp designs.  With the introduction of the new Gen3 products, the OSLON Submount PL family is expected  to maintain its strong market position in standard static headlamps for  entry-level vehicles and electric vehicles. The OSLON Submount PL Gen3 family features variants with one  of two options for the light-emitting area (LEA), giving headlamp makers the  flexibility to meet different customer specifications in a product with a  single board layout: ‘These new LEDs are equally applicable to static headlamp  designs, in which the light source is mounted directly on the heatsink,  eliminating the need for a high-performance PCB, and to standard modules, in  which the LED is mounted on an open-frame housing,” says Philipp Puchinger,  product marketing manager for Automotive Forward Lighting. “In both  cases, the introduction of the latest generation of OSLON Submountv PL  LEDs gives automotive manufacturers a roadmap to higher efficacy and lower  system costs.’ The new LEDs maintain the characteristics of quality and value  offered by earlier generations of the OSLON Submount PL product line,  says the firm. They are supplied in tightly specified single-color bins,  enabling manufacturers to streamline their inventory and to simplify the  assembly process. The LEDs also offer high thermal stability and a uniform  beam pattern characterized by homogeneous color-over-angle radiation.
