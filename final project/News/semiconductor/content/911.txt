CDI to distribute AmpliTech Group MMIC Design Center products AmpliTech Group Inc of Hauppauge, NY, USA has agreed for Component Distributors Inc (CDI) to market and distribute all  MMICs (in either die or packaged forms) released by its AmpliTech Group MMIC Design Center (AGMDC) Division in Plano, Texas, which was founded  in 2021 and designs, develops and manufactures signal-processing components for  satellite and 5G communications networks, defense, space and other commercial  applications. This is AGMDC’s first distribution agreement, presenting an  opportunity to reach not just domestic customers but also global customers that  are currently being served by CDI. “We specifically chose CDI to become our distribution channel  given CDI’s ample reach, engineering support and distribution capabilities,”  says AmpliTech’s founder & CEO Fawad Maqbool. “This effectively sets the  table for both our semiconductor packages and MMIC divisions to streamline  their product offerings, paving the way for continued new product introductions  in the SATCOM, 5G and quantum markets,” he adds.
