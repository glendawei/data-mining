BAE Systems awarded $5m ONR contract for COALESCE program BAE  Systems ─ which develops and services electric propulsion technology at its  facilities in Endicott, NY, USA and Rochester, UK ─ says that its FAST Labs research and development  organization has been awarded a $5m contract by the US Office of Naval Research  (ONR) for the program COALESCE (Common-architecture Amplifier for Low-cost,  Efficient, SWaP-Constrained Environments), whose objective is to develop the  world’s highest-efficiency high-power amplifier module in its frequency band. FAST Labs  will develop gallium nitride (GaN)-based monolithic microwave integrated circuit  (MMIC) and module electronics. The radio-frequency (RF) modules will then  transition to small-form-factor US Navy payloads, enabling longer range  and greater effectiveness in active electronic warfare applications. “The COALESCE  program closes the gap between commercial electronics and customized  electronics to meet the Department of Defense’s space and power requirements  and enable next-generation solutions,” says Ben McMahon, technology development  manager at BAE Systems’ FAST Labs. “Together with the Office of Naval Research,  we will deliver these electronic solutions to increase survivability for our  warfighters.” BAE Systems will  provide capabilities above and beyond what can be found commercially, and its  solution is designed specifically for harsh DoD operating environments. The  technology’s high power and ultra-small form factor will enable  next-generation radar, electronic warfare (EW), and communication  applications. MMICs and modules  for the program will be fabricated at BAE Systems’ Microelectronics Center  Foundry in Nashua, New Hampshire. The FAST Labs organization in  Merrimack, New Hampshire will work to ensure the technology is relevant  across multiple DoD branches, applications, and businesses.
