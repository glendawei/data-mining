NUBURU completes US Air Force AFWERX SBIR Phase II contract NUBURU Inc of Centennial, CO, USA —  which was founded in 2015 and develops and manufactures high-power industrial  blue lasers — has completed  the AFWERX Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II  contract awarded by the US Air Force in 2022. Supported by metal additive  design and manufacturing firm GE Additive  (part of GE), NUBURU demonstrated blue laser-based 3D printing  solutions with area printing technology, as set forth in the contract as  the goal for the project. This first-ever demonstration of using a blue laser beam  shaped with a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) to print a part in stainless steel  is said to represent a milestone in the development of a 3D printing light engine  for incorporation into large-scale additive manufacturing systems, it is  reckoned. NUBURU and GE Additive also signed a joint development  agreement in June to accelerate the development of print engine technology  that may result in improved speed and accuracy for laser-based additive manufacturing. “We have successfully demonstrated the ability to print in metal  with a scalable blue laser DMD architecture that will allow much faster  printing speeds, as well as lower defect density than today’s 3D  metal printers,” says NUBURU’s CEO Brian Knaley. “Achieving this milestone  is critical to accelerate the implementation of blue laser technology into  large-scale additive manufacturing systems for defense, aerospace and several  other critical markets.”
