Modelithics and RFMW collaborate Modelithics Inc of Tampa, FL, USA —  which provides standardized model libraries and custom modeling services for  RF, microwave and millimeter-wave electronic device electronic design  automation (EDA) — is collaborating with RFMW (a specialty electronics  distributor providing RF, microwave and power components and semiconductors, as  well as component engineering support) to expand the resources readily  available to engineering designers and suppliers. The collaboration offers engineering designers rapid access to  obtain device components and technical information that includes device  datasheets as well as highly accurate simulation models for suppliers including  Qorvo, Marki Microwave, Smiths Interconnect, Knowles, Spectrum Control,  and Guerilla RF. “Collaborating with Modelithics will allow our customers to gain  easy access to high-quality simulation models that will reduce design time  and overall costs,” says RFMW’s president Joel Levine. “Facilitating an optimal  development experience — from introduction to production — is a key part of our  RFMW Value-Added Distribution strategy.” Through the Modelithics Vendor Partner (MVP) program, many  suppliers are sponsoring free extended use of Modelithics models, for  customers that do not already have access to the Modelithics’ COMPLETE Library  or its customized vendor-specific libraries, such as the Modelithics Qorvo GaN  Library and the Modelithics MACOM GaN Library.
