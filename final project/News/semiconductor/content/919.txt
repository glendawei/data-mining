Lumentum completes acquisition of Cloud Light for $750m Lumentum Holdings Inc of San Jose, CA,  USA (which designs and makes optical and photonic products for optical networks  and lasers for industrial and consumer markets) has completed its acquisition (announced at the end of October) of Cloud Light Technology Ltd of Hong Kong (which designs  and makes optical transceiver modules for  automotive sensors and data-center interconnect applications). “Cloud operators have embraced this transaction, recognizing the  enhanced customer value proposition it brings through leading-edge technology,  a broader product portfolio, and strengthened supply chain security, all at a time when artificial intelligence is driving data-center  compute capacity to its limits,” says Lumentum’s president & CEO Alan Lowe. Cloud Light was acquired  for about $750m (before certain  adjustments), paid in cash from Lumentum’s balance sheet and the assumption and  substitution of outstanding unvested Cloud Light  options. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to  Lumentum’s non-GAAP earnings per share and to more than double the firm’s cloud  data-center infrastructure revenue in the 12-month period following the  transaction close. The complementary combination is reckoned to position  Lumentum as a leader in providing photonics to cloud operators, enabling a more  than five-fold expansion in the company’s served opportunity inside of data centers. In the last 12 months, over 90% of Cloud Light’s more than $200m in revenue was  derived from 400G-and-higher-speed products and, in their most recent quarter,  over half of Cloud Light’s optical  transceiver revenue was derived from 800G transceivers.
