CGD forms GaN ecosystem with Chicony Power and Cambridge University Technical Services Cambridge GaN Devices Ltd (CGD) — which  was spun out of the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s  Electrical Power and Energy Conversion group in 2016 and designs, develops  and commercializes power transistors and ICs that use GaN-on-silicon  substrates — has signed a  tripartite agreement with Taiwan-based Chicony Power Technology Co Ltd  and Cambridge University Technical  Services (CUTS, a subsidiary of Cambridge Enterprise) to conceive and develop  efficient, high-power-density adapters and data-center power products using gallium nitride. Chicony Power is a provider of power electronics systems focusing on power supplies (including switch-mode power supplies) and adapters for applications  including notebooks, desktop computers, gaming devices, and server/cloud  solutions. Lead consultant on behalf of CUTS is professor Florin  Udrea, head of Cambridge University’s High Voltage  Microelectronics and Sensor (HVMS) group, which has a 25-year history in power device design, TCAD simulations and  characterization of power devices. The three parties will collaborate on a  technical project ‘Innovative low power  and high power SMPS (switch-mode  power supplies) with advanced GaN  solutions’. CGD has historic and ongoing links with Cambridge  University via chief executive officer  Giorgia Longobardi and chief technology officer  Florin Udrea, who also still leads the HVMS group.
