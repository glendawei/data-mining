Diamond Foundry creates first diamond-based electric car inverter Diamond Foundry Inc  (DF) of San Francisco, CA, USA has created an electric car  inverter leveraging its diamond wafer technology to enable greater efficiency. Tesla led the power electronics revolution in electric cars  by leading the adoption of silicon carbide. But the new power electronics  unit is reckoned to be six times smaller than that of a Tesla 3 while  delivering more power more efficiently. This level of miniaturization is  enabled through a design enabled by diamond wafers in combination with  established silicon carbide dies. The design of power semiconductors is essentially driven by two  factors: thermal conductivity – the path to cool them down – and electrical  conductivity – the path to carry high currents. Though the electrical path has  been worked on for many years more or less successfully, the thermal path has  always been the main challenge. Further, power semiconductors  need to be isolated from the rest of the environment because of safety required  with high voltages. Voltage isolation barriers usually demonstrate poor thermal  conductivity. The firm says that diamond wafers can now be employed using two of  its extreme properties: extreme thermal performance plus extreme electrical  insulation. It adds that the advent of cost-efficient diamond wafers creates  fundamental new design opportunities for power electronics  that were not possible before.
