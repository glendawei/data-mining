Diamond Foundry creates first 100mm single-crystal diamond wafer Diamond Foundry Inc (DF) of San Francisco, CA, USA says  that it has created the world’s first 100mm single-crystal diamond wafer. A culmination of work that DF team members started three decades  ago, creating the first diamond wafer required the development of technologies  including a single-crystal lattice on scalable substrates, large-area diamond  ingot growth, diamond singulation technology, and precision-surface processing. No wafer-sized diamond exists, so DF had to create the “mother of  all diamond wafers” then use it to produce more. Employing diamond  heteroepitaxy — which creates single-crystal diamond on scalable substrates —  and combining it with other technologies, the firm created the first ever wafer  that is a single crystal of diamond. Prior simulants existed effectively  in the form of compressed powder of diamond but with properties not matched by  a single crystal, the firm adds. In comparison with natural resources, the largest rough diamond  ever mined on Earth (the Cullinan  Diamond) has a largest dimension of 5.89cm, which is more than 4cm smaller than  DF’s diamond. DF says that its next goal is to further reduce the defect density  of its diamond wafer – to realize the textbook semiconductor figure of merit  of diamond, which is 17,200 superior to silicon and 60 times superior to  silicon carbide.
