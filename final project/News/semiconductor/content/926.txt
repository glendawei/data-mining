Hitachi Power Semiconductor Device to be transferred to MinebeaMitsumi Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd has agreed to transfer all the shares of  its subsidiary Hitachi Power Semiconductor Device to MinebeaMitsumi Inc  of Nagano, Japan. Since being established in October 2013 through the integration of  Hitachi and Hitachi Haramachi Electronics Co, Hitachi Power Semiconductor  Device has provided products utilizing high-voltage and low-loss power semiconductor  technologies, with insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)/silicon carbide  (SiC), high-voltage ICs and diodes as its three main product categories. The firmâ€™s IGBT/SiC products are targeted at decarbonization market  sectors where high growth is expected, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and  inverters for wind power generators, as well as railroad applications. In  high-voltage ICs for industrial and home appliance applications, Hitachi Power Semiconductor  Device contributes to system efficiency improvement and noise reduction through  motor control technology and software. It also provides diodes for  automotive applications, which require high reliability over a long period of  time. After much discussion with parent firm Hitachi on measures to  achieve further growth and enhance corporate value, it was concluded that the  best way for Hitachi Power Semiconductor Device to continue its growth was  as part of MinebeaMitsumi, which positions the analog semiconductor business as  one of its core businesses. Under MinebeaMitsumi, with whom Hitachi Power Devices has  been collaborating for many years, Hitachi Power Semiconductor Device aims  to enhance its strengths in high-voltage, low-loss technologies, expand its  production capacity and improve manufacturing efficiency to provide  higher-value-added products in larger quantities.
