Next Level Epitaxy for aluminium nitride thin films Aluminium nitride (AlN) epitaxial thin films have garnered  significant attention due to their exceptional properties, rendering them  highly suitable for a wide spectrum of devices such as quantum acoustodynamics,  integrated photonics, lithium batteries, LEDs and high-frequency, high-power electronics. To meet the demands of these applications, the team of  experts at Element 3–5 GmbH has pioneered a groundbreaking methodology for the  mass production of AlN epitaxial thin films, presenting a substantial leap in  the domain of semiconductor fabrication. This innovative method is known as  Next Level Epitaxy (NLE). In the context of NLE, a seamless integration of 
        physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition  (CVD) techniques has enabled epitaxial thin-film growth at surface temperatures  below 300°C. The NLE growth process shares a fundamental resemblance  to the thin-film fabrication stages employed in the metal-organic chemical  vapor deposition (MOCVD) process. However, in the case of NLE, a distinctive feature  emerges as each of the fabrication stages (cleaning, nucleation, and growth)  incorporates the use of various plasma sources. Designed, developed and  manufactured at Element 3–5 GmbH, these proprietary plasma sources enable  processing of 35 x 300mm, 70 x 200mm, 140 x 150mm or 300 x 100mm wafers at each  cycle, leading to significant reduction of production costs compared with  existing methods.
