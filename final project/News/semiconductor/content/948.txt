ams OSRAM launches its first street-approved LED retrofit lamp for H1 sockets ams  OSRAM GmbH of Premstätten, Austria and Munich, Germany is expanding its series of LED retrofit lamps. With the street-approved  OSRAM NIGHT BREAKER H1-LED,  drivers can legally, easily and cost-effectively upgrade their conventional H1 halogen low-beam and high-beam head-lights to LED technology. Due to the NIGHT BREAKER H4 and H7 LED lamps, motorists in  Germany can already benefit from LED retrofit lamps on more than 200 models  from different vehicle manufacturers. The launch of the new NIGHT BREAKER H1-LED (available now  for 144.99 euros, RRP) opens  up this benefit to at least 19 further models with H1 sockets. The NIGHT BREAKER H1-LED produces bright white  light with a color temperature of up to 6000K. A special feature of the LED  retrofit lamp is its low level of glare, which is up to 40% less than the  permitted maximum value (compared with the minimum requirements of ECE R112). Despite its high output, the NIGHT BREAKER H1-LED consumes up to 55% less  energy than conventional lamps thanks to its advanced LED technology. This also  has a positive effect on the lamp’s longevity. Together with the specially  developed compact, vibration-resistant design, it results in a service life up  to five times longer than traditional halogen lamps, it is reckoned. Upgrading  from halogen to the NIGHT BREAKER  H1-LED does not require any modifications to the vehicle so anyone with a  reasonable level of competence can do it, or it can be done the next time the  car is being serviced. ams OSRAM says  that it is constantly working on wider approval of the NIGHT BREAKER LEDs. Retrofit lamps are  available for a variety of contemporary motorcycles, classic cars, trucks and motorhomes in addition  to cars.
