Luminus launches SST-12 high-power white LED for directional lighting Luminus Devices Inc of Sunnyvale, CA, USA –  which designs and makes LEDs and solid-state technology (SST)  light sources for illumination markets – has announced the immediate availability of the SST-12, a  high-power white LED featuring a  patented round emitter that is  claimed to set a new standard in directional lighting by significantly  enhancing the quality and brightness of beam spots. Compared with square-shaped  emitters, the SST-12’s round emitter offers advantages: its compatibility with  typically round-shaped optics results in superior brightness and color  uniformity within beam spots, and it provides a tighter beam angle and longer beam distance, making it a suitable choice for  a wide range of directional lighting applications.
