ams OSRAM adds 0.33” DLP-compatible LEDs to OSTAR Projection Power range ams OSRAM GmbH  of Premstätten, Austria and Munich, Germany has added four new LEDs  to its family of OSTAR Projection Power products. The new LEDs are said to  produce superior optical performance in projection equipment that is based on a  0.33” DLP (Digital Light Processing) imager. Available now  in production volume, the new OSTAR Projection Power LE xx P1MS/AS  LEDs have a very close etendue match with the 0.33” DLP imager. The LEDs are  available in Blue (LE B P1MS-EQET-23), Amber (LE A P1MS-RQRU-2), Deep Blue (LE D P1MS-ETFQ-R) and Converted Green (LE CG P1AS-TPTS-A) colors. When used in a typical four-channel configuration, these  OSTAR Projection Power LEDs produce an output of 880lm on  projector level. This is 5% brighter than the next best 0.33” DLP-compatible  LEDs available from competitors, according to internal ams OSRAM tests. The OSTAR  Projection Power LE xx P1MS/AS LEDs are supplied in a compact  package with a footprint of just 6.8mm x 7.6mm. The package has a copper  metal-core PCB with isolated solder pad,  making thermal system design easier  and reducing the cost of thermal components.
