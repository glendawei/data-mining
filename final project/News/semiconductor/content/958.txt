Power Integrations’ PowiGaN technology used in solar car race across Australian Outback Power Integrations Inc of San Jose, CA, USA,  which provides high-voltage integrated circuits for energy-efficient power  conversion, is providing PowiGaN gallium nitride (GaN) technology,  expert design support,  and financial sponsorship for Team aCentauri  in the 3000km Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, which begins in  Darwin on 22 October with  38 entrants and is expected to conclude in Adelaide on 29 October after crossing the  Australian Outback. “After  studying Power Integrations’ extensive list of reference designs, Team aCentauri asked us to help  them design a power converter  based on the 750V InnoSwitch3-EP with PowiGaN technology,” says Trevor Hiatt,  director of marketing at Power Integrations. “With our IC and expert design support, the team not only  boosted energy efficiency  to 95.7% while the system operates at maximum power but also improved  efficiency by more than 50% while the system drives light loads – which is most  of the time.”
