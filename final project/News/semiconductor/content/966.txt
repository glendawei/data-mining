Riber’s MBE 49 GaN aims to compete with MOCVD for 200mm GaN-on-Si Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which makes  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources – says that it continues to improve and  develop its system portfolio with the advent of the MBE 49 GaN, a  mass-production machine dedicated to growth the growth of gallium nitride (GaN). Riber highlights the latest order for an MBE 49 production machine for III–nitride applications (GaN, AlN), announced on 3 October, in the context of a particularly  competitive ecosystem with metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD). “This order results from significant research  and development work to optimize our 200mm MBE 49 production  machine in order to meet the production challenges of advanced GaN- and  AlN-based optoelectronic components,” says Dr Jean Louis Guyaux, Riber’s chief technology officer. “It also confirms the relevance of our partnership initiated in 2018  with CNRS–CRHEA [Centre de Recherche sur  L’Hétéro-Epitaxie et ses Applications – Centre National de la Recherche  Scientifique] in Sophia Antipolis,  France [which specializes in epitaxial  growth of wide-bandgap semiconductor materials] through the development of a joint laboratory. Riber is delighted  with the excellent results of this collaboration and the exceptional  performance achieved with the MBE 49 GaN, which is generating real interest from  the scientific and industrial community worldwide,” he adds. “Developing a technology that is ahead of its  time on the market has required Riber to combine strategic vision with a  willingness to invest in a bold and ambitious R&D program,” comments CNRS–CRHEA director Philippe Boucaud. “CRHEA was a pioneer in GaN growth by MBE.  It was therefore natural for it to make a long-term commitment to Riber, taking  a significant risk on 200mm GaN by MBE... This [the MBE 49 GaN]  is a remarkable success in the context  of an exemplary partnership between CNRS and Riber.”
