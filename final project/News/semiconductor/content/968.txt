GE Licensing, Current Lighting, Savant and Seoul Semiconductor enter into patent license agreement GE Licensing (GEL), Current Lighting Solutions LLC, Savant Systems Inc and South Korean LED  maker Seoul Semiconductor Co Ltd (SSC) have entered into a patent license whereby SSC has acquired  a license to a PFS (also known as KSF) patent portfolio for all application  fields widely licensed by the LED industry. Seoul Semiconductor  says that, due to this collaborative agreement, it has emerged as the unique  beneficiary of GEL’s PFS patent portfolio for all applications, such as  display, lighting and automotive. The impact of this agreement in the emerging  electric vehicle sector should be  especially critical, where the parties expect the benefits of in-vehicle  displays and lighting containing PFS to significantly reduce power consumption. “We are pleased  to welcome SSC back to the ranks of our PFS licensees, so that we can both  focus on innovating and creating LED products that are critical to the world,”  says GE Licensing’s president  Patrick Patnode. “Seoul Semiconductor, as a company that respects intellectual  property rights, values the patent portfolios of GE Licensing,  Current Lighting  and Savant,” says Chung H. Lee, founder of Seoul Semiconductor  and Seoul VioSys. “The rights granted today in this license agreement further  strengthens Seoul Semiconductor’s second-generation patent portfolio  of 18,000 patents and significantly enhances our ability to move products to  the market,” he adds.
