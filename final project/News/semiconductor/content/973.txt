POET collaborates with Yuanjie for laser supply as optical engines enter volume production POET Technologies Inc of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada — designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer, photonic  integrated circuits (PICs) and light sources for the data-center,  telecom and artificial intelligence (AI) markets — is enabling its joint venture Super Photonics Xiamen (SPX)  to ramp optical engines to high-volume production by utilizing the high-speed indium phosphide (InP) lasers of Yuanjie  Semiconductor Technology Inc (YST), which was founded on 28 January. “As we start ramping production of our optical  engines, securing an additional reliable laser source that is well established in the  industry with known good quality is of utmost importance to our business,” says POET’s  chairman & CEO Dr Suresh Venkatesan. “Our partnership with YST has enabled  POET and SPX to deliver reliable, high-performance optical engines to customers.  SPX will start production of 100G CWDM4, POET ONE (a 100G single-chip TxRx engine), 100G LR4 and 200G FR4 optical engines using YST’s  directly modulated lasers (DMLs) this month and we expect to extend the collaboration  to other products in the future,” he adds. “Our superior quality lasers and reputation  for reliability will complement POET’s Optical Interposer technology, which  offers a unique and highly adaptable platform to module makers,” comments YST’s  CEO & chairman Peter Zhang. “We will continue to collaborate with POET on  high-speed optical engines while supporting SPX to ramp current products to high-volume  production.” POET, SPX and YST will initially collaborate  on 100G CWDM4, POET ONE, 100G LR4 and 200G FR4 transmitter  products. All the design verifications and reliability testing of the optical engines is complete  and all will be released to production during October. Current module customers  for these products include ADVA, Beijing FeiYunYi (BFYY) and Fibertop, along  with others whose names have not yet been disclosed.
