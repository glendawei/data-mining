First droplet epitaxy of InAs quantum dots on InGaAsP quaternary alloy University of Sheffield in the UK reports  the first demonstration of indium arsenide quantum dot (QD) growth on indium gallium arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP,  lattice matched to the InP substrate) by  droplet epitaxy (DE) [Elisa  M. Sala et al, Phys. Status Solidi RRL, p2300340, 2023]. The 1400–2200nm photoluminescence emissions  from the resulting QDs cover the low-loss telecom C-band 1530–1565nm, along  with other important telecom optical fiber bands,  such as O and L. QDs are seen as having strong potential for telecom lasers,  pure single-photon and entangled photon pair emissions for quantum information  technologies, and for novel nanomemory devices. The team adds: “The investigation of InAs  QD growth embedded in InGaAsP/InP is particularly important given the extensive  use of this quaternary alloy as waveguide material for telecom lasers.”
