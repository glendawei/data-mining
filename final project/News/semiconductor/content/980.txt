k-Space achieves ‘A’ rating in VDA 6.3 P6 Process Analysis/Production assessment k-Space Associates Inc  of Dexter, MI, USA – which was founded in 1992 and produces thin-film metrology  instrumentation and software for research and manufacturing of microelectronic,  optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices – has earned an ‘A’ result — the  best possible result — on its recent VDA 6.3 P6 Process Analysis/Production  assessment. “The VDA quality standard is required by  automotive manufacturers in Germany,” notes CEO Darryl Barlett. “As a global  manufacturer of thin-film metrology tools for the semiconductor industry, and  of industrial metrology solutions for the automotive, glass, and solar panel  industries, it’s a standard we strive to meet and surpass.” The VDA 6.3 standard is used by the  German automotive industry and is followed by companies that supply German car  manufacturers such as Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW, as well as by non-automotive  companies. It is an auditable standard consisting of seven parts (P1–P7). The  P6 component of the VDA 6.3 standard refers to Process Analysis/Production.  This phase checks that the necessary measures have been taken to ensure that quality  products are built and delivered on time and meet customer requirements.  Factors that are assessed include: The ‘A’ score “demonstrates independent  recognition of the process and production capabilities at k-Space,” says quality manager  Doug Knoll.
