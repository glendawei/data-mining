BluGlass a commercial partner in US Microelectronics Commons regional innovation hub CLAWS BluGlass Ltd  of Silverwater, Australia — which develops and manufactures gallium nitride  (GaN) blue laser diodes based on its proprietary low-temperature,  low-hydrogen remote-plasma chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology — has been named a member of the ‘Commercial  Leap Ahead for Wide-bandgap  Semiconductors’ (CLAWS) Hub, one of eight Microelectronics Commons regional innovation hubs announced by the US Department of  Defense, with the aim of developing next-generation photonic devices with  significant commercial and strategic defence applications in the decades ahead. The US DoD  awarded US$238m in CHIPS and Science Act funding in fiscal year 2023 for the establishment of eight  regional innovation hubs, as part of the US$2bn allocated to the ME  Commons Program from fiscal years 2023-2027.  The Microelectronics Commons is focused on bridging and accelerating the  lab-to-fab transition and mitigating supply chain  risks and aims to boost America’s ability to develop, prototype, manufacture  and produce cutting-edge microelectronics at scale. Led by North Carolina State University (NCSU), the  CLAWS Hub has been awarded US$39.4m for the base year of performance and  consists of seven hub members: North Carolina  State University (Hub Lead), Adroit  Materials, BluGlass, Coherent, General Electric,  Kyma, North Carolina A&T State University, and Wolfspeed. “The work we will  be contributing to the hub perfectly aligns with BluGlass’ wide-bandgap and  extended-wavelength roadmaps and will leverage the benefits of our proprietary  RPCVD technology,” says BluGlass’ CEO Jim Haden. “We are delighted  to be partnering with BluGlass in the NCSU-led CLAWS Hub, working together to  innovate next-generation III-N photonic and optoelectronic solutions with  BluGlass further adding a path to commercialization,” says Fred Kish, MC Dean Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “The  photonic technologies in the hub hold the potential to enable quantum  technologies, communications, artificial intelligence  applications, position/navigation/timing, biotechnical and medical, materials  processing, displays, and a host of additional defense needs,” he adds. “They  are also important for national security  applications by providing energy efficiency,  size, weight, power and performance advantages in critical application areas  including weapons systems, war fighter outfitting, and a host of  additional defense needs.”
