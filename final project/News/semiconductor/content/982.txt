Determining droop in green InGaN LEDs Researchers based in the USA report that  “intrinsic Auger–Meitner recombination was found to be the primary  mechanism for non-radiative recombination” in green indium gallium nitride  (InGaN) light-emitting diodes (LEDs),  according to their experimental studies [Xuefeng Li  et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., v123, p112109, 2023]. The team from University of New Mexico, Lumileds LLC  and Sandia National Laboratories in the USA comment: “The efficiency droop can  be attributed to the imbalance between radiative and intrinsic Auger–Meitner  recombination due to carrier localization and Coulomb enhancement in the LEDs  studied. Thus, maintaining a low carrier density  in thin QWs is advantageous for avoiding strong intrinsic Auger–Meitner  recombination and utilizing the interplay of carrier localization and Coulomb  enhancement on the radiative process.” The Auger–Meitner  mechanism is also often referred to as just Auger recombination. Although Lise  Meitner reported the effect in 1922 as a by-product of other research, Pierre  Victor Auger independently discovered and studied the mechanism more deeply,  documenting his work in 1923.
