Riber receives order for MBE 49 system Riber S.A. of Bezons, France – which makes  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems as well as evaporation sources – says that a new Asian  industrial customer has placed a multi-million Euro order for a  MBE 49 system, for delivery in 2024. The purchase provides  production capacity for optoelectronic components based on III-nitride  materials (GaN, AlN) for the light-emitting diode  market (UV LEDs, white LEDs and micro-LEDs). Riber says that the new order confirms the market’s adoption of  MBE 49 as one of the most efficient  multi-wafer thin-film deposition systems for the development of electronic  applications based on compound semiconductors.
