Coherent’s 200G PAM4 DFB-MZ laser wins ECOC Award for Most Innovative Product Materials, networking and laser technology firm  Coherent Corp of Saxonburg, PA, USA says that its 200G four-level pulse amplitude  modulation (PAM4) distributed-feedback laser and Mach–Zehnder modulator (DFB-MZ), combined monolithically in a  photonic integrated circuit (PIC), has won the 2023 ECOC Exhibition Industry Award for Most  Innovative Product in the category of Innovative Photonics Component. The PIC enables 200G per lane in both re-timed  and linear pluggable 800G and 1.6T transceivers. The 200G PAM4 DFB-MZ was first  demonstrated at March’s Optical Fiber Communications conference (OFC 2023) in San Diego, CA, USA (an industry first, it is claimed).  Coherent again gave a live demonstration of the 200G PAM4 DFB-MZ at the European Conference on  Optical Communications (ECOC 2023) in Glasgow, Scotland, UK  (2–4 October). This live demonstration showcases the DFB-MZ that transmits a 200G PAM4  signal over a 6km fiber. “We have combined into one PIC the functional  elements and integration experience of several of our most advanced devices,  which are each breakthrough innovations on their own,” says chief marketing officer Dr Sanjai Parthasarathi.  “This PIC incorporates our knowledge from electroabsorption-modulated lasers,  IQ modulators for  coherent applications, and tunable lasers with Mach–Zehnder modulators. It will enable higher-performance,  longer-reach PAM4 optical links.” Featuring a channel-specific chirp control  that is said to provide excellent dispersion management, the DFB-MZ supports  wavelength division multiplexing  (WDM), including local area network (LWDM) and coarse (CWDM) wavelength plans. A  cooled DFB-MZ supports LWDM for reach up to 10km. An uncooled DFB-MZ supports  CWDM for shorter reaches.
