Semtech and Coherent demo 200G-per-lane differential driver with 200G DFB-MZ laser High-performance  semiconductor, IoT system and cloud connectivity service provider has Semtech Corp of Camarillo, CA, USA has announced  the demonstration of its latest FiberEdge 200G PAM4 MZM driver driving the  200G DFB-MZ laser of materials,  networking and laser technology firm Coherent Corp of Saxonburg, PA, USA. Coherent is conducting a  live demonstration of Semtech’s FiberEdge 200G PAM4 Quad MZM driver with  Coherent’s 200G DFB-MZ laser in Coherent’s booth #406 at the European  Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC 2023) in Glasgow, Scotland,  UK (2–4 October). “We are very excited to  continue our collaboration with Coherent as advanced lasers and optics get  developed in the 200G-per-lane space,” says Nicola Bramante, senior product line  manager for Semtech’s Signal Integrity Products Group. “This demonstration  confirms once again the interoperability of state-of-the-art 200G lasers  with Semtech’s latest 200G-per-lane FiberEdge developments, ensuring superior  linearity and signal integrity in 200G-per-lane Mach–Zehnder  modulator-based applications, both in indium phosphide (InP) and silicon photonics.  This enables rapid and scalable deployment of next-generation high-performing  and reliable switches in data centers,” he adds. “Coherent continues to demonstrate  its leadership in 200G-per-lane laser technology, which is a fundamental  building block of 1.6T transceivers with up to 10km reach,” says Coherent’s  chief marketing officer Dr Sanjai Parthasarathi. The joint demonstration at  ECOC includes a differentially driven DFB-MZ InP laser from Coherent and  Semtech’s PAM4 driver, demonstrating a clear path toward 1.6T and 3.2T optical transceiver  deployments in data centers.
