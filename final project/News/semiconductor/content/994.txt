IQE launches first 6” InP DFB laser platform for AI and data-center applications Epiwafer and substrate maker IQE plc of Cardiff,  Wales, UK has announced  what it says is the industry’s first 150mm (6") indium phosphide (InP) platform  enabling the scaled production of electro-optic devices at the core of artificial intelligence (AI),  machine learning and cloud data-center networks. In collaboration with the University of Glasgow’s  James Watt  Nanofabrication Centre and its commercial arm Kelvin  Nanotechnology (a supplier of nanofabrication services for  prototyping and production), IQE has developed a process-ready 6”  distributed feedback  (DFB) InP laser wafer platform, enabling customers to deliver high-volume laser  solutions supporting the rapid growth in high-speed optical data links. IQE says that its data infrastructure semiconductor materials are employed  across a diverse range of transceiver platforms. As a pioneer in InP, it is  further demonstrating the technology’s scalability, enabling a step change in  volume manufacturing to satisfy an increasing demand for DFB lasers. The firm  adds that this also ensures that optical interconnect technology remains cost  competitive, as network traffic scales to meet the requirements of generative  AI and data-intensive applications. “We are pleased to be able to offer our  data-infrastructure customers an industry-first: laser epitaxy on a 6” InP  wafer platform,” says Peter Rabbeni, senior VP,  IQE’s Communications Infrastructure & Security business unit. “Scaling our  current laser materials technology to deliver a  fab-ready service at this size provides an immediate competitive advantage and  faster time to market,” he  adds. “We are  delighted to be able to demonstrate a DFB grating  technology fully deployed on a 6” InP  platform with high yield and uniformity, and we look forward to working with  IQE in bringing this capability to the market,” comments Kelvin  Nanotechnology’s CEO Dr Brendan Casey.
