TRUMPF breakthrough in sub-wavelength grating reducing RMS and RIN values TRUMPF Photonic Components GmbH  of Ulm, Germany (part of the TRUMPF Group) – which makes  vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and photodiodes for the  consumer electronics, datacoms, industrial sensing & heat treatment  and automotive markets – is showcasing its recently updated VCSEL  product portfolio and technology with matching photodiodes in booth 641 at the European  Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC 2023) in Glasgow, Scotland, UK (2–4 October). The  firm is expanding its product portfolio beyond the well-established 25G and 56G  components with higher data rates  (up to  100G), longer wavelengths,  extended temperature ranges  and higher performance. “We continuously strive and make investment to pursue  new technologies that improve the performance of our VCSELs and photodiodes in  the datacom field,” says Ralph Gudde, VP marketing & sales. “Our newest  breakthrough in sub-wavelength grating is designed to reduce RMS and RIN values  for our multi-mode and single-mode VCSELs, enabling a lower bit-error rate (BER) for data  transmission over longer fiber,” he adds. TRUMPF  is investing in several technologies to improve the power, cost and reliability  benefits of VCSELs for future applications. The developments include  long-wavelength VCSELs and single-mode VCSELs with polarization gratings. The  long wavelengths span 980nm to 1310nm and even higher, addressing longer-range  datacom and automotive applications. Increased bandwidth, lower power consumption, additional  multiplexing options and superior noise control  are among the expected benefits of the development of single-mode VCSELs and  polarization gratings. The solutions continue to offer transmission at higher  data rates and higher  temperatures, resulting in improved overall system performance.
